### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** a dusky 2015 tannat from bodega garzon (uruguay, £29) meets its match in trusty co-op malbec, £6 and bold by the glass.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Pull up with a Hobgoblin Ruby Ale, deep as the evening, or swap for an Aspall Suffolk cider when curry’s heat calls for crisp sweet comfort; either sits well beside.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Noor suggests a cucumber, mint and lime fizz, elegantly chilling alongside peppery curry notes.

*A warming, fragrant slow-cooked beef curry packed with tender beef, peppers, tomatoes, and fresh coriander, letting your slow cooker do the hard work for you.*
