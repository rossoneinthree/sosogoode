## Method

Large pack of chicken wings
Add a very light salt seasoning (lighter than you would ever season them normally)
Then grill them (or bbq but grill works better than the oven)
Make sure they're as crispy as possible on both sides but concentrate on the main
skin side.
Put them in a large bowl and then make a dry seasoning marinade:
Equal parts:
White Sugar,
Salt
5 Spice
Completely drown them in it
