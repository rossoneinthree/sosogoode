### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 domaine de la garrelière “le chenin”—quince, warm spice, a whisper of honeyed smoke. twenty-three quid. would melt into the harissa like a secret. or just grab a dry riesling.
2021 dönnhoff riesling trocken—clean snap of lime and mineral. eleven quid. cools the fire, keeps it crisp. or just go with a pinot grigio.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Siren Yulu – smooth, light stout with vanilla hum. won’t fight the harissa.
Hogan’s Killer Sharp – proper sour cider, sharp edge. balances the whole thing.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber Harissa Cooler
Muddled cucumber, lemon juice, a dash of harissa syrup, topped with soda. Fresh, fiery, refined. Serve tall with ice and a mint sprig.

*Delicious, chewy, cheesy, crisp on top … slam it in the oven and it’s ready in half an hour*
