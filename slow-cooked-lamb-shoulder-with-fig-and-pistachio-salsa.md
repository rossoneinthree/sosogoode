## Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.

Put the chopped onions, garlic, ginger, spices and herbs into a food processor and blitz until finely minced. Add the oil, vinegar, 1¾ teaspoons of salt and a generous grind of pepper and blitz into a coarse paste.

Pat dry the lamb and pierce the flesh all over using a small, sharp knife (about 10–12 times). Coat the lamb well with all the paste. You can cook it right away or leave it to marinate, refrigerated, for 3 hours to overnight.

Put the onion wedges, cinnamon sticks, cardamom and figs into a large, ovenproof cast-iron saucepan (28cm in diameter) for which you have a lid. Alternatively, use a large, high-sided roasting tin and some foil to cover. Top with the lamb, fatty side up, then pour the chicken stock into the pan (but not over the lamb) and bake uncovered for 45 minutes. Lower the heat to 140°C fan, baste the lamb with the juices, then cover with the lid or foil and roast for 4½ hours, basting 3–4 times throughout. The lamb should be quite tender at this point. Turn the heat back up to 180°C fan. Remove the lid (or foil) and cook for 30 minutes more, or until the lamb is well browned and the sauce has reduced slightly. Check it at the 20-minute mark.

Gently remove the lamb, leaving it to rest on a baking tray. Pour the contents of the saucepan into a large, shallow platter or dish that has a slight lip and top with the lamb.

Make the fig and pistachio salsa. Combine the chopped figs with the pistachios, lemon juice and the herbs. Spoon this all over the lamb and serve with the lemon wedges alongside.

Fig and pistachio salsa:

– This is best made on the day it is served.

– It marries really well with a cheese toastie or alongside gooey baked Brie.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 chinon from bernard baudry. crushed berries, graphite, wild herbs. twenty-two quid. a quiet anchor for the lamb. or just go with a rioja.
soft dried figs and warming spice… needs something earthy, fluent in shadow. this cabernet franc has a whisper of forest floor and restraint.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** The Kernel Export Stout
Ross-on-Wye Dabinett Medium Cider
That stout’s got roast and richness for days. Dabinett’s sharp and old-school—cleans up the lamb without flinching.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Saffron Citrus Spritz
Saffron syrup, fresh lemon juice, orange blossom water, topped with tonic. Delicate spice meets sharp citrus. Regal, radiant—just like the dish.

*This is the perfect special-occasion centrepiece, as it’s just a matter of assembling everything in the pan and leaving it to do its thing in the oven. The hardest part is the waiting time, really, as your kitchen is filled with the most tantalising aromas of sweet spices*
