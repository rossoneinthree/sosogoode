### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 vermentino di gallura—brine, citrus pith, and bitter herbs. twenty-two quid. sunshine in a bottle. or just have a sauvignon blanc.
clean and coastal—needs something that knows the sea. this one dances with prawns like they’re old friends.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Peroni Nastro Azzurro
Henny’s Dry Cider
light touch with good fizz. the peroni’s crisp enough for the tomato, and henny’s cider keeps it bright without fightin’ the prawns.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Citrus & Bay Leaf Spritz
White verjus, bay leaf syrup, a squeeze of orange, topped with soda. Herbal, zesty, feather-light. A coastal breeze in a glass.
