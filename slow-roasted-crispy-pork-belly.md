### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 Ribera del Duero. Nothing fancy. Just dark, strong, and structured enough to carry that fat.
Crackling meets tannin. Meat meets plum. No notes.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Timothy Taylor’s Landlord. Proper pint. Dry enough to cut the fat, but still got a backbone.
Fridge temp, not freezing. Eat with your hands.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Roasted barley tea. Cold. Slightly smoky, barely sweet—lets the pork speak.
Serve in a small glass, no ice. Respect the crackling.

*This slow-roasted pork belly cooks confit-style in its own fat, yielding ridiculously juicy, tender meat and crowned with the most amazing crispiest crackling of your life. It comes down to 3 game-changing tips: 1) Don’t score the skin; 2) Roast low, then finish hot; 3) Keep the pork level with foil balls.*
