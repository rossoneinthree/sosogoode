### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 chateau de pibarnon blanc—white peaches, fennel, salt breeze. provençal grace, twenty-eight quid. or just have a picpoul de pinet.
silky broth, garlic, sea. this one needs something that hums in tune—stone fruit, herbs, quiet tension.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St. Austell Proper Job IPA
Perry’s Farmhouse Dry Cider
big garlicky fish soup? needs sharp hops or sharp apples. proper job’s crisp bite sorts it. perry’s dry cider’s got that old-school tang. both cut through.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Rosemary & Lemon Spritz (zero-proof)
Bright, herbal, and structured. Lemon cuts, rosemary lingers. Over ice, with a sprig—clean foil to the rich aïoli.

*Raymond Blanc’s fish soup with aïoli, a mayonnaise with garlic and olive oil that you mix in to the soup to make it delicious - worth the effort*
