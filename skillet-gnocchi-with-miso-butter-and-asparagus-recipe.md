### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 terlaner cuvée from alto adige. almond and mountain air. crisp and layered.
or just drink a chardonnay.
buttery miso and sweet asparagus—this dish hums in quiet tones. needs something alpine, something clean, to let the richness echo.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Augustiner Helles
Henney’s Dry Cider
miso’s got depth so you want snap n’ fizz. this lager’s gentle but steady. cider’s tart with a wink. both’ll do.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber and yuzu highball
Bright, saline, sharp. The cucumber cools, the yuzu lifts. A highball with hush and glow.

*This skillet gnocchi recipe has a spring in its step: It takes just 10 minutes to cook and is loaded with sweet springtime asparagus and baby greens But that doesn’t mean the flavor is fleeting: The combination of miso, butter and vinegar forms a silky, rich sauce that glosses the seared gnocchi and vegetables and anything else you wish to add Perhaps that’s the crunch of sliced radishes or toasted pistachios, or the crispness of a fried egg or seared fish.*
