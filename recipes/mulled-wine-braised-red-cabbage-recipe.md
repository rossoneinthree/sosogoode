### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2016 spatburgunder from meyer-näkel—smoky cherries, clove, autumn leaves. thirty-seven quid. soft and brooding. or a pinot noir.
glow of spice, hum of fruit—this wants something red but patient. a slow wine for a slow dish.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St. Bernardus Prior 8
Dunkertons Black Fox Cider
yeasty and warm on the beer, like raisin cake. cider’s got tannins and bite. both’ll sit right in that spiced cabbage swirl.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Fig & Thyme No-Groni
Deep, dusky notes to echo the mulled wine. Fig syrup, verjus, thyme infusion, orange twist. Stirred cold. Velvet in a glass.

*Red cabbage wedges are braised in mulled wine in this easy festive side dish recipe.*
