### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2016 barbaresco from produttori. rose petals, rust, old leather gloves. thirty-five quid. total class. or a cabernet sauvignon.
heavy spice, deep lamb richness—wants a red that can go dark and stay dancing.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Poppels West Coast IPA
Ross-on-Wye Dabinett Medium Dry
rich dish, needs sharpness and depth. IPA’s pine bite cuts, cider’s soft fizz cools it all down.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Tamarind Spice Cooler
Tamarind syrup, lime, ginger shrub, soda. Tart, smoky, gently sweet. A hush against the heat.

*Rogan josh just like they make in the best Indian restaurants, It’s all about garlic, ginger, spices and deeply browned onions.*
