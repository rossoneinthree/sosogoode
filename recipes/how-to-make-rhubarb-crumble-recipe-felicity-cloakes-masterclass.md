### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 pinot gris from zind-humbrecht. baked pear, smoke, and soft spice. twenty-five quid. leans into the crumble like a whisper.
or just have a moscato d’asti.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St. Bernardus Wit
Sheppy’s Vintage Reserve Cider
Bit of spice, bit of snap. Sweet-tart crumble loves the tang from both.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Rosemary & Rhubarb Collins (zero-proof)
Rhubarb cordial, lemon, soda, rosemary sprig. Cuts the sweetness, lifts the mood. Serve tall and cold.

*The humble crumble is rubbly heaven, and a real cinch to perfect*
