### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 chablis 1er cru montmains—wet stone, lemon oil, cold steel. precise and mineral. forty quid. would hum alongside the pâté. or just grab a picpoul.
2021 pepière muscadet—lemon, seashells, lightning. bright and proper. or just have a sauvignon blanc.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Stiegl Goldbräu—clean, soft lager, won’t fight the fish
Dunkertons Black Fox—lush orchard fruit, cuts the goat’s cheese lovely

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery & green apple spritz
Clean, herbal, and bright—an elegant match for fish, cheese, and cured meats. Serve tall, with thyme.

*Scoop up Marcus Wareing’s homemade mackerel pâté and herby baked goats’ cheese with slices of crusty bread. Don’t forget the melon and meat on the side.*
