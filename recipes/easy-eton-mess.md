### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** benji would go for a whisper of château d’yquem sauternes 2016 (£210) if feeling lofty, or a crisp bottle of sainsbury’s taste the difference muscat for a plebeian treat.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** rugsby reckons a gentle wheat beer like hoegaarden will swirl happily with berries and cream. for that summer bounce, crack open an aspall suffolk cider—bring it to the park and let crumbs fall where they may.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** noor suggests a pink berry spritz—muddled raspberries, lemon, and sparkling elderflower, served chilled in cut glass.
