### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 grosset polish hill riesling—lime, flint, tension like wire. thirty-two quid. lean and electric, perfect with spring greens. or a dry riesling.
2021 alsace pinot blanc—soft pears, white flowers, touch of almond. thirteen quid. gentle and kind. or a viognier.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Saison Dupont
Dunkertons Organic Cider
beans and spears need a fresh edge. saison’s got zip. dunkertons keeps it bright but earthy.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber & Tarragon Fizz
Crisp cucumber juice, splash of verjus, tarragon syrup, topped with soda. Herbaceous, clean. A garden in a glass.

*Joey O’Hare serves up a stunning salad of asparagus, served atop a cannellini bean hummus recipe delicately flavoured with seasonal wild garlic.*
