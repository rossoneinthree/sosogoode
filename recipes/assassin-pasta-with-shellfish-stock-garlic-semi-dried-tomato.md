## Ingredients

•	200g dried spaghetti (or pasta of your choice) , 	•	3 tbsp olive oil , 	•	2–3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced , 	•	4 sun-dried tomatoes in oil, finely chopped , 	•	2 fresh tomatoes, grated or finely chopped , 	•	500–600ml shellfish stock (hot) , 	•	Salt, to taste

## Method

Method
	1.	Infuse the Oil:
In a wide, cold frying pan, add the olive oil and sliced garlic. Place over medium heat and let the garlic gently infuse until just golden. Stir in the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and let them sizzle for a minute or two.
	2.	Add the Fresh Tomato:
Stir in the grated or chopped fresh tomatoes. Let it cook down for a few minutes until it thickens and starts to caramelize slightly.
	3.	Toast the Pasta:
Push the tomato mixture to one side of the pan. Add the dry pasta straight into the pan (break if needed to fit) and toast it lightly in the oil for a minute or two, flipping occasionally. This gives the pasta its signature assassin-style flavor.
	4.	Add the Stock Gradually:
Begin adding the hot shellfish stock ladle by ladle, just like risotto. Let the pasta absorb the liquid slowly. Stir occasionally, but not too much — you want some crispy bits to form at the bottom. Adjust seasoning with salt and optional chili flakes.
	5.	Cook Until Al Dente:
Continue adding stock and cooking until the pasta is al dente and coated in a rich, concentrated sauce. You’re aiming for that slightly caramelized, sticky texture on the bottom.
	6.	Finish & Serve:
Let it rest off the heat for a minute. Garnish with fresh parsley if you like. Serve immediately — assassin pasta waits for no one.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Etna Bianco. Volcanic, crisp, and mineral. Handles the shellfish and garlic like a pro. Serious wine with swagger. Alt: Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Fresh, salty, citrusy bang-on with tomato and shellfish. Won’t rinse your wallet.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** beer: Paulaner Münchner Hell – buttery smooth, not shouty. lets the stock do the talkin.
cider: Ross-on-Wye Dabinett – rich, proper chewy. bit like slurpin apples off a wet dock.

(for when u fancy trouble but still light a candle)

*It’s pasta that bites back. Crisp, rich, unapologetic. You don’t stir it—just let it catch.*
