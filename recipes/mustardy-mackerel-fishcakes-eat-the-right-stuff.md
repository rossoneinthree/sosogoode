### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 domaine de la taille aux loups montlouis—quince, chalk dust, golden grip. twenty-six quid. sings the same salty song. or just grab a dry riesling.
sharp fish, sharp wine—clean tension, quiet fire. the mustard threads it together like silk.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Orval Trappist Ale
Dunkertons Organic Dry Cider
bit of funk and fizz needed here. fishcake’s rich, mustard’s got heat. this’ll keep it lit but grounded.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Lemon Highball
Lemon cordial, a touch of mustard seed syrup, soda, smoked salt rim. Cuts through oil, echoes the edge. Serve icy, no garnish.

*Salmon has been bumped off its fishcake pedestal.*
