## Ingredients

Pork belly. , Corn / Flour tortillas (worst case use Turkish Lavash bread and cut into smaller pieces or steamed bao buns if you prefer but personally i think they fill you up too quickly. , Would recommend making your own corn tortillas. They're fairly easy, find a recipe. Basically 2 cups maize flour, 1 ½ cups warm water. Make a dough, let it hydrate, cut into balls, then press them out with a tortilla press or folded grease proof paper and squish them round with a heavy bottomed saucepan. Fry in a little pork fat.

## Method

MAKE THE MARINADE

Mix ingedients

Mince shitloads of garlic, ginger and spring onions. (It's almost impossible to add too
much aromatics)

That's your marinade, It will later become your MASTER SAUCE.
COOKING THE PORK

LIghtly score the skin of the belly or lightly jab it 100 times with something pointy or
better still a Jaccard if you have one (they have a zillion needles). LIberally add salt
into the scored crevices.
Get an Oven dish just big enough to sit the pork belly snugly.
The marinade should come all the way up the sides but make sure it doesn't go
anywhere near the top layer of skin. You want that untouched for maximum cripsing.
The sauce will make the skin chewy rather than crispy. Be vigilant.
Marinade In the fridge 6 to 8 hours but 24-hours if you really want the flavor to kick you in the
face.

PREP TACO TOPPINGS WHILE PORK IS COOKING
-

-
Fresh chopped pineapple (chargrill it before you chop if you wanna elevate flavour
and give it an el-pastor pineapple smoke)
Pink Pickled Onion slices (Premade From shop is fine)
Crushed Peanuts.
Black Sesame seeds (adds color contrast against peanuts)
Chopped raw chilli.
Chopped Spring onion (green tops only)
Chopped mint.
Chopped Coriander.
ALT addition: Add some kind of raw veg slaw. Sliced carrots/kale/cabbage/cucumber
with a dressing or sesame oil and vinegar. Or just go with the textured garnishes (or
both if you're good at eating ugly).

LETS COOK
-

-
Oven at 350º
4 to 6 hours (depending on size of meat but slow and low always wins)
After 2 hours Keep checking on it.
If the fat layer is starting to catch or get too darken then just put tin foil over the fat
you're essentially braising the Flesh in the liquid.
Take the Dish out of the oven.
Skim the fat off the marinade / cooking liquor and set aside.
Tip the remaining marinade (cooking liquor into another pan and reduce until it's a
thick sauce. (this will taste almost too flavorful, that's normal - set it aside.
This is your MASTER SAUCE.
TO CRISP THE SKIN
-

Wrap the tin foil around the sides of the meat exposing just the top layer of fat.
Crank the oven to high or use a grill if you want but if you're using a grill be careful
because it can burn very quickly then just keep going until it's unbelievably bubbling
and crispy.
Remove the crispy skin in one piece.
Chop the crackling into bite size pieces. Set aside.
SEASONING THE PORK WITH MASTER SAUCE
-
-
-
Cut / Shred the meat into pieces, but make it chunkier than pulled pork.
Take the meat and fold through with the reduced marinade / MASTER SAUCE.
Taste. This should be the best thing you've ever eaten in your life.
LETS SERVE
-
-
-
-
Fry the tortillas one one side in the skimmed pork fat from the sauce.
Add some pork.
Add the garnishes you prefer but include the pineapple and crackling pieces.
Squeeze a lime over.
I like to serve this omakase style with all my friends stood around in the kitchen drinking
while I hand them all individual tacos straight off the grill.
ALT make a large platter of pre-assembled tacos and make it rain with the herbs and
toppings at the table for drama.
‘CHEATS’ KIMCHI
A simpler alternative to serve with Pork tacos - it's quicker you just want the meat and cant
be bothered to chop all the garnishes.
-
-
-
-
Get a jar of sauerkraut / sliced cucumbers from your local Turkish shop.
Remove the pickling liquor.
Add a spoonful of gochujang Korean chili paste and a splash of sesame oil and you
get instant kimchi.
Spoon on top of pork tacos.

the fridge and you can eat it for literally weeks if you're a pig.*
