## Method

Start by making the oil. Put the garlic and lime zest in a small pan, pour over the olive oil, then heat slowly to one side of the barbecue (or on the stovetop), until the garlic starts to fizz a little; take off the heat, add the salt and leave to infuse.

Season the asparagus spears and lettuce with two tablespoons of the infused oil (take the oil from the top, keeping all the garlicky bits for later), then sprinkle with a little flaky sea salt and some ground black pepper.

Grill the asparagus and the lettuce cut side down on a hot barbecue (or, if indoors, a very hot griddle pan), until they start to char and cook. Transfer the charred lettuce cooked side up to a platter, then top with the griddled asparagus.

Mix the lime juice into the remaining garlic oil, add the chopped pistachios, drizzle the dressing all over the salad and serve.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 sylvain pataille marsannay rosé. salty strawberries, white pepper, surprisingly serious.
or just go with a rosé from the supermarket.
grilled greens, lime oil, pistachio crunch—this wants something pink and alert. the marsannay dances with char and citrus. the cheap rosé will do just fine, if it’s cold and dry.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Camden Pale Ale
Dunkertons Organic Dry Cider
green crunch and smoke? camden pale’s got the zip. dunkertons is orchard-sharp, works a treat with lime and fire.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Lime, Cucumber & Basil Cooler
Crisp, garden-fresh. Muddled cucumber and basil over ice, topped with lime juice and soda. A green mirror to the dish. Serve in a chilled coupe with a basil leaf.

*Celebrating British asparagus is almost like a national holiday; we love the season and wish it was longer. A version of this dish has appeared on every spring menu at our restaurant Honey & Smoke in central London for the past eight years, and this one is easy to make at home, either on a barbecue or in a griddle pan in the kitchen. It will hopefully become a spring staple for you, too.*
