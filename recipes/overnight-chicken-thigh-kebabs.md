## Ingredients

•	240ml plain whole milk Greek yogurt , 	•	30ml extra-virgin olive oil , 	•	2 tsp paprika , 	•	½ tsp ground cumin , 	•	⅛ tsp ground cinnamon , 	•	1 tsp crushed chilli flakes (use ½ tsp for milder heat) , 	•	Zest of 1 lemon , 	•	30ml freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 lemon) , 	•	1¾ tsp fine sea salt , 	•	½ tsp freshly ground black pepper , 	•	5 garlic cloves, finely minced , 	•	1.1 to 1.4kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 4cm pieces , 	•	1 large red onion, cut into 2.5cm chunks , 	•	Vegetable oil, for greasing the grill

## Method

Instructions
	1.	Make the Marinade
In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, olive oil, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, chilli flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic.
	2.	Prepare the Skewers
Line a baking tray with foil for easy cleanup. Thread the chicken pieces onto metal skewers, folding if pieces are long, and alternate with chunks of red onion. Don’t overcrowd the skewers—you’ll need about 6 to 8 skewers.
	3.	Marinate
Brush the remaining marinade all over the skewers, coating thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.
	4.	Grill the Kabobs
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat (about 200°C / Gas Mark 6). To grease the grill, dip a wad of kitchen paper in vegetable oil and, using tongs, rub over the grates until coated and glossy.
	5.	Cook
Grill the kabobs for 13 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through. Use a metal BBQ spatula to help release them if they stick.
Internal temperature should reach 74°C in the thickest part of the chicken.
	6.	Serve
Transfer to a serving platter and enjoy warm.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 assyrtiko from gaia—salted lemon, white smoke, and sun-bleached stone. twenty-two quid. dances with the marinade. or just grab a sauvignon blanc.
good albariño from rías baixas. zippy, clean, tastes like green apple washed in sea salt. or just grab a pinot grigio.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Camden Pale Ale
Aspall Premier Cru cider
Pale ale keeps it fresh, bit of citrus in there plays off the yogurt spice. Cider’s sharp and golden, proper barbecue match.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Lemon & Cardamom Spritz
Bright citrus, a whisper of warm spice. Serve over ice with a twist of orange peel. Elegant, uplifting, unforgettable.
