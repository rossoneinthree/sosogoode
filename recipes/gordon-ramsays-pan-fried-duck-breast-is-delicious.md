### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 chambolle-musigny from hudelot-noëllat. crushed violets, red cherries, silk and shadow. sixty quid. would whisper back to the duck. or a pinot noir.
2019 crozes-hermitage—black pepper and smoke. twenty quid. leaner, darker, still a fine match. or just have a shiraz.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St. Bernardus Prior 8 – belgian dubbel, deep and caramelly. proper with the duck fat.
Perry’s Somerset Redstreak Cider – sharp, earthy, bit tannic. stands up to that cherry sauce.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cherry Balsamic Shrub Spritz
Cherry shrub, dash of balsamic, soda, crushed ice. The acid cuts, the fruit matches. Serve in a coupe, garnish with thyme.

*It’s a classic for a reason*
