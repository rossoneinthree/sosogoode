## Ingredients

350 gms 70% dark chocolate broken into chunks, , 225 gm salted butter, , 5 large free-range eggs,  , 210 gm caster sugar divided into 2/3 cup and 1/3

## Method

Preheat the oven to 120 C / 248F.
Butter and line a 23 – 25 cm cake tin with baking paper. If you are using a springform cake tin, wrap some foil around the cake tin so as to prevent any water from leaking in. It is better not to use a springform tin here.


Melt the chocolate and butter 


Beat the eggs and 70 grams of the sugar with an electric mixer until the volume expands to roughly 4 times.


Heat the remaining 140 gms of sugar with 100 ml of water until dissolved and allow it to boil for about 1 -2 minutes (it will be a light syrup).


Pour this syrup into the chocolate and butter mixture and allow it to cool a little.


Pour the chocolate into the egg mixture and mix through until all combined and then pour into the baking tin. 


Put a folded tea towel into the bottom of a deep-sided oven dish and place the cake on this (this will prevent the cake from slipping).


Pour hot water into the pan so that it comes 3/4 of the way up the sides of the pan (I used mainly boiling water but also added tap water to bring the temp down from boiling too hot).
Bake for 50-60 minutes until set. The cake will be ready when it just starts pulling away from the sides of the tin.  Allow the cake to cool in the pan of water before removing and turning it out.
Notes
Allow the cake to cool in the cake tin in the water before removing it and placing it on a serving plate. This cake can be made in advance and refrigerated until required.
