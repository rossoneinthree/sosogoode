## Method

Instructions:

Sauté Aromatics: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 5-7 minutes until softened.

Add Meat (if using): Add chopped sausage or pancetta and cook for another 3-4 minutes until browned.

Add Garlic and Greens: Stir in garlic and your dark greens (kale, chard). Let them wilt slightly, about 3 minutes.

Add Broth and Beans: Pour in the broth and add the beans. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer for 10-15 minutes.

Add Bread and Season: Stir in the torn bread to thicken the soup. Season with salt, pepper, and herbs. Simmer for another 10 minutes.

(Optional): Add tomatoes or extra veggies as it simmers, or even a spoon of tomato paste to enhance the flavor.

To Serve: Ladle into bowls, drizzle with a little olive oil, and serve with grated Parmesan if you like.

Alternative Ingredients:
Greens: Use spinach, Swiss chard, or even frozen peas if you don’t have kale.

Beans: Kidney beans, chickpeas, or lentils work too.

Bread: If you don’t have stale bread, just toast regular bread and add it.

Meat: Leave it out for a vegetarian version, or use bacon or ham if you want a smoky flavor.

Broth: Water can work in a pinch, though broth adds more depth.

Variation Ideas:
Add a few spoonfuls of tomato paste or canned tomatoes for more richness.

If you like a spicy kick, toss in some red pepper flakes.

Cheese: Top with grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese for extra flavor.
