## Ingredients

568ml Pot of Double Cream , 250g Tub of Mascarpone , 75ml of Marsala , 5 tbsp of Golden Caster Sugar , 300ml of Strong Coffee , 2 x Pack of Sponge Fingers , 25g of Dark Chocolate , 2 tsp of Cocoa Powder , 2 x Drops of Vanilla Extract , 2 x Egg Yolks

## Method

STEP 1
Mix the egg yolks and sugar - 2 to 3 mins
STEP 2
Put in the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and whisk till all completely combined
and has the consistancy of thick whipped cream
STEP 3
Pour the coffee into a shallow dish.
Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they
are nicely soaked, but not soggy.
Layer these in a dish until you’ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread
over half of the creamy mixture.
STEP 4
Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate.
Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.
STEP 5
Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.
STEP 6
To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.

*A luxurious, boozy twist on the classic Italian dessert—perfect for cosy gatherings and festive feasts. Layers of coffee-soaked sponge fingers meet a rich, whipped mascarpone cream spiked with marsala and vanilla, all topped with a generous snowfall of cocoa and dark chocolate. Best made the night before so the flavours have time to settle into something magical.*
