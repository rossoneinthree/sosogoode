### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2019 morgon from jean foillard. silky raspberries and dark soil. twenty-eight quid. would absolutely sing with this.
or a merlot.
earth and warmth, crisped edges and gentle depth. potatoes like this deserve a red with soul.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Timothy Taylor’s Landlord
Thistly Cross Traditional Cider
bit of browning on the spuds? this’ll ride with it. proper pint job. buttery enough for the cider too.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Thyme & Lemon Highball (zero-proof)
thyme syrup, lemon juice, soda. chilled, herbaceous lift for roasted gold. serve tall with a strip of zest.

*These melting potatoes are creamy, caramelized coins that melt in your mouth*
