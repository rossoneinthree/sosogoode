## Ingredients

25g unsalted butter , 1 large onion, peeled and sliced , 1 large leek, trimmed and finely sliced , 400ml fish stock , 400ml milk , 300g smoked pollack fillet , 250g potatoes, peeled and cut into small chunks , 2 sweetcorn cobs , 2 sweetcorn cobs , Parsley, to garnish

## Method

Sweat the onions and leeks in butter for a few minutes. Add the stock and milk in equal proportions. Add the fish, and lightly poach it in the broth. Strip the corn cobs and pare off the niblets with a sharp knife.

When the fish is done, lift the fillets from the pan and set aside in a colander to cool. Add the potatoes to the liquor. While they are simmering, flake the fish into a bowl and discard the skin along with any stray bones. When the potatoes are almost done, add the sweetcorn to cook for the last couple of minutes. Return the flaked fish to the pot and stir. Serve in small bowls with a garnish of parsley.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Savennieres brings quiet smoke and a waxy flex—almost too perfect.
But don’t sleep on South African Chenin from the Co-op. It’s £6 and punches clever.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Orkney Skull Splitter. Malty, smoky, and a bit much. Which fits.
Drink with: damp jumper.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Charred apple and lapsang soda. Smoke laced with orchard.
Sip like you’re remembering something.
