- 500ml beef stock
- Bouquet garni (piece of dark green leek end, thyme, rosemary, bay)
- Black pepper
- Salt

### Sauté Vegetables
- 30g salted butter (divided)
- 200g shallots
- 200g button mushrooms
- 3 carrots, diced
- 20g tomato purée

### Duchesse Potatoes
- 1.3kg Estima potatoes
- 50g butter
- 3 egg yolks
- Nutmeg
- Salt and pepper

### To Finish

## Method

### Filling (Part 1)
1. Preheat oven to 150°C. Put the red wine in a pan and reduce by 2/3 or until it starts to taste sweet.

2. Over a medium high heat, add the olive oil, season the meat with fine salt and brown the shin and short rib all over until dark golden brown in colour.

3. Add the reduced wine, beef stock and bouquet garni.

4. Cover with a cartouche, add a lid and put in the oven at 150°C for 2.5 hours.

### Sauté Vegetables
1. Add 10g of the butter to a pan and bring to foaming.

2. On a medium high heat, sauté the mushrooms for 4-5 minutes until softened and golden, before removing from the pan and setting aside.

3. Add another 10g of the butter, turn the heat down to medium and sauté the shallots for 4-5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden.

4. Add the remaining 10g butter and on a medium heat, add the carrots. Sauté for 4-5 mins until starting to soften and colour. Add the tomato purée and cook out for a couple of mins before removing from the pan.

5. Combine all the vegetables together, and set aside, ready for later.

### Filling (Part 2)
1. After 2.5 hours, pick out the bouquet garni.

2. Pull the meat apart before adding the carrots, onions and mushrooms and cover with the cartouche & lid. Return to the oven for 30 mins.

3. Season and leave to cool - potentially over ice.

### Duchesse Potatoes
1. Heat the oven to 180°C and bake the potatoes, whole, for 40 minutes or until soft.

2. While still warm, scoop out the inside, push through a fine drum sieve and fold through the egg yolks and butter until smooth. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste.

### Assembly & Finish
1. Fill a small pie or casserole dish with the filling.

2. Pipe the Duchesse potatoes over the top and leave to cool.

3. Brush the top of the potato with clarified butter before baking at 180°C for 30 minutes (until the potato is golden).
