## Ingredients

100g oats , a good handful of pecan nuts (about 50g), roughly chopped , 1 teaspoon baking powder , a pinch of sea salt , 1 ripe banana, peeled and mashed , 150ml coconut milk or almond milk (see note above) , a 200g punnet of blueberries , To serve , 2 bananas, peeled and cut into thin slices , a little coconut oil or butter , a few pecan nuts, crumbled , lime wedges , honey or agave syrup

## Method

Before you start
First turn the oven to 120°C/fan 100°C/gas 1⁄2 to keep everything warm.

To make the batter
Blitz the oats until you have a scruffy oat flour. Add to a bowl with the pecans and throw in the baking powder and salt. Mix the mashed banana with the milk (you can do this by blitzing them together in the food processor, if you like). Beat the banana mixture into the flour and leave the batter to sit for a few minutes.

Heat a non-stick pan on a medium heat, then add the banana slices and fry on both sides in the dry pan until brown and caramelised. Keep warm in the oven.

Put the pan back on a medium heat and add a little coconut oil or butter. Drop in a healthy tablespoonful of batter for each pancake. Once the sides are cooked and bubbles have risen to the top, scatter over a handful of blueberries and flip the pancake over. Cook for another couple of minutes on the other side. The pancakes will stay a little moist in the middle because of the banana, so don’t worry. Keep them warm in the oven while you cook the rest.

To serve
Serve the pancakes piled with the banana slices. Add some crumbled pecans and a squeeze of lime, and, if you like, a little touch of honey, agave or maple syrup. A scoop of coconut and banana ice cream turns these into a feel-good pudding too.
