### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 pepière muscadet—lemon, seashells, lightning. bright and proper.
or just have a sauvignon blanc.

the sea calls softly through this dish. salt, heat, breeze. you want something clean and sharp—something that glints like sunlight on water.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Augustiner Helles
Perry’s Somerset Dabinett cider
fresh and crisp meets salty and soft. proper thirst quencher. sip slow, smile faster.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery & Lime Spritz
briny, bright, with a flick of chile syrup. mirrors the dish’s snap and shimmer. serve tall, icy, with a celery ribbon.

*Spaghetti alle vongole, an Italian classic, is a light pasta infused with garlic, briny clams, white wine, and chile flakes.*
