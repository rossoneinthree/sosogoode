## Ingredients

1.2kg	waxy potatoes, such as Anya or Yukon Gold, peeled and halved, or quartered if huge , 170g	petits pois or garden peas, fresh or frozen , 1	celery stick, trimmed (and if at all tough, slide a sharp vegetable peeler over the ribbed surface to destring it – it really is worth it, I promise), then finely diced , 30g	cornichons or gherkins, chopped , 6	hard-boiled eggs (see tip below) , 4	spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced a big handful of (about 20g)	 , ½ (about 180g)	a cucumber, cut into 1cm dice , a big handful of (about 20g)	fresh parsley, leaves and fine stems, roughly chopped , 	For the vinaigrette: , 3 tbsp	white wine vinegar , 2½ tbsp	Dijon mustard , ½ tsp	salt , A few grinds of	black pepper , 140ml	mild olive oil , For the dressing: , 70g	mild mayonnaise, such as Hellmann’s , 70g	thick Greek yoghurt , 1 tbsp	Dijon or wholegrain mustard – I like to use wholegrain here, for the pretty seeds , salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

First, cook the potatoes. Put them into a pan of salted water, bring to the boil, then simmer until tender when pierced with a small, sharp knife, about 10–12 minutes. (While they’re boiling, make the vinaigrette as described below.) Drain the potatoes in a colander and let them steam for a few minutes to lose some of their moisture.

In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper, then slowly trickle in the oil, whisking as you go, until it’s thickened and glossy. Gently toss the still-warm potatoes in the dressing and leave to cool completely. You can do this the day before you want to serve it if you like, just cover and refrigerate them.

Cook the peas in a pan of boiling water, or steam them – 2 minutes for petits pois, 3 minutes for garden peas. When cooked, rinse under very cold water to stop them cooking further and losing their colour, or plunge them into a bowl of iced water.

Toss together the potatoes, peas, celery, cucumber, cornichons and capers. Roughly chop 4 of the eggs (reserve the rest to put on the top at the end) and gently fold them in.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 terlaner cuvée from alto adige. almond and mountain air. crisp and layered. or just drink a chardonnay.
all that creamy egg, gherkin snap, soft herb and mustard… needs a wine with lift, with whisper. cool and alpine. or just reach for what’s cold and white.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Augustiner Helles
Pulpt Flare cider (Herefordshire)
that mix of mayo, bite and herb wants a pint that’s clean and soft. lager handles it. or get a sharp, tart cider to ping off the peas and pickles. bang on.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery Gimlet (non-alc) — celery shrub, lime, Seedlip Garden, dash of agave
crisp, vegetal, quietly electric. pulls the green notes forward and cleans the palate. serve icy. twist of cucumber to finish.

*My own potato salad adheres strictly to my belief that two good things are invariably better than one good thing, so yes please to both vinaigrette and mayonnaise. I dress the still-warm potatoes in a sharp, mustardy vinaigrette and leave them to cool completely before cracking on with the rest. Then I toss the potatoes with celery, cucumber and gherkins, spring onions, peas, boiled eggs and parsley, before folding it all in a combination of mayonnaise and thick yoghurt spiked with a little more mustard.
Sometimes I add capers, and sometimes I vary the herbs - tossing in some chives, chervil and/or tarragon along with the parsley. If I'm making it the day before - and I usually am - I add the herbs and the onion when I give it a last stir, about an hour before serving. To me, it's the essence of pure contentment and pleasure: easy, comforting, to be enjoyed in big, heaped spoonfuls on summer plates, but also - with any luck - there will always be enough left over for me to enjoy on late-night solitary forages through the fridge, when it often tastes the most delicious of all.*
