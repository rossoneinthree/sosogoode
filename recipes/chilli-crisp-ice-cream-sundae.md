*smooth and sweet vanilla ice cream topped with a tongue-numbing swirl of vibrant red, crunchy-bit-laden chilli oil. Yep, chilli crisp does in fact go with everything – even dessert. Savoury, spicy, rich, creamy and crunchy, this unusual ice cream topping went viral for good reason, and I am so here for it. British (Chinese Asian dessert all  allpro)*
