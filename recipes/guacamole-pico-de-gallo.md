## Method

Before you start
Preheat oven to 180˚C | Pastry brush (can use the back of a spoon if needed) | Sieve

Bake your tortilla crisps
Brush the tortillas with oil on both sides, then cut into triangles
Sprinkle the flaky salt and your seasoning all over

Bake in a single layer in the oven for around 5-6 minutes until golden and crisp (watch carefully as they can over-bake very quickly, and rotate the sheets around if some pieces are browning quicker than others!)
Once out of the oven, add a final sprinkling of flaky salt and leave to cool

Make your guac - prep the avocado
Halve and carefully stone the avocados by lodging the stone firmly with the heel of a knife and pulling out

Spoon the flesh out of the avocado in chunks, put it in a mixing bowl and mash it lightly with a fork
Make your guac

Rigorously roll the lime around on the kitchen surface with your palm to help release the juices, halve and squeeze in the juice, then mix well with the avocado (this helps stop the avocado discolouring)

Peel and finely chop the shallot
Peel and crush the garlic
Finely chop the cherry tomatoes
Finely chop the chilli or add the chilli powder

Finely dice the coriander leaves and fine stems (no need to pick the individual leaves, just grab your coriander bunch in two hands and pull them apart to separate the top leaves from the long stems)
Mix everything together and add salt to taste and more lime juice if needed

Make your pico de gallo

Deseed and dice the tomatoes, add to a bowl with a generous sprinkle of salt and mix well
Leave to stand while prepping the rest of the ingredients
Make your pico de gallo
Trim, halve, deseed and finely slice the jalapeño

Peel and finely dice the shallot
Pick the coriander leaves and roughly chop

Rigorously roll the lime around on the kitchen surface with your palm, slice it in half and squeeze the juice into a mixing bowl

Sieve the tomatoes to drain excess juices

Add the drained tomatoes, chilli, shallot and coriander leaves to the bowl and fold to combine
Season to taste with salt and more lime juice if needed

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 pepière muscadet—lemon, seashells, lightning. bright and proper.
or just have a sauvignon blanc.
salt and lime and sun. tortilla shards and soft green mash. this wants something coastal, sharp, and clean. let the wine cut through like sea breeze on skin.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Beavertown Neck Oil
Aspall Draught Cider
lime and chilli, you need bright and sharp. neck oil’s light enough, and aspall’s got zip. snacky session dream.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Tomatillo Verde
A vivid green blend: tomatillo juice, lime, coriander stem, and a hint of jalapeño, shaken over ice. Fresh, vegetal, alive—mirrors the guac and pico’s garden snap.

*Guacamole and Pico de Gallo are classics which truly deliver on the minimum effort: maximum taste ratio, and no Mexican feast would be complete without them.*
