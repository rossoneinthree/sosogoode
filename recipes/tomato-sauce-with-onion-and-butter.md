## Ingredients

•	400g tin good peeled tomatoes , 	•	60g unsalted butter , 	•	1 onion, peeled and halved , 	•	Salt, enough but not too much

## Method

1.	Melt butter gently. Place onion, cut-side down, in the pan. Brown gently, 7–8 minutes. Don’t burn it. Zeffie’s watching.
	2.	Add tomatoes. Salt gently. Simmer quietly, 45 minutes. Stir occasionally. Remove onion.
	3.	Serve simply—pasta, bread, spoon.

Zeffie’s secret:
“pinch of sugar sometimes. when tomatoes sulk. keep it quiet.”

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Chianti Classico Riserva—classic, dusty, just enough attitude for Zeffie’s sauce.
Or pull a Montepulciano—soft tannin, deep red, no notes needed.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Moretti. Gets out of the way. Like a good left back.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked tomato shrub with soda. Warmth without weight.
Serve in a wine glass. No need to explain.

*This sauce looks suspiciously simple. That’s because it is. Just tomatoes, butter, onion, salt. Zeffie insists you brown the onion first—cut-side down, slowly, patiently—until it tells you something sweet. Only then do you pour in the tomatoes.

No garlic, no herbs, no nonsense. Trust it.*
