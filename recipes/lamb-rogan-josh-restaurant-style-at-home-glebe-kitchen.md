### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2016 côtes du rhône from saint-cosme—blackberry smoke, cracked pepper, dusky herbs. twenty-two quid. would murmur alongside this. or just have a shiraz.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Sierra Nevada Pale Ale
Thatchers Katy Cider
rogan josh bangs with weight. sierra’s got the hops to spar. katy’s sharp n’ bright to slice through.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Tamarind Ginger Nojito
Tamarind’s sour kiss, ginger’s heat, mint’s cool hush. perfect against deep, spiced lamb.

*Lamb rogan josh is one of the classic Indian dishes for a reason. It’s delicious. And it’s even better when you make it restaurant style.*
