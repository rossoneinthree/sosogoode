### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Jura Chardonnay—nutty, golden, almost philosophical.
But honestly? Macon-Villages from Aldi. £7. It’s the coat that makes the outfit.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** beer: Timothy Taylor’s Landlord – cosy pint. knows how to hug a pie without makin a fuss.
cider: Aspall Premier Cru – posh but not snooty. crisp meets crisp. zingy like a good insult.

(best enjoyed in socks. big ones.)
