### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Meursault if you’re showing off—elegant oak, buttered steel.
Otherwise, a cold Picpoul is basically legal performance-enhancing for fish.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Augustiner Helles. Sharp uniform. Doesn’t overpower the fish.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery tonic with lemon oil. Precise. Cool. Like brushed chrome.
Drink before speaking.
