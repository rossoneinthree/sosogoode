## Method

Instructions:

1. **Make the Relish**:  
   - Put the vinegar and sugar into a small saucepan with 60ml of water and ½ tsp salt.  
   - Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute, stirring once or twice, until the sugar is dissolved.  
   - Remove from the heat and cool.  
   - Add cucumber, ginger, chilli and coriander.  
   - Transfer to a sealed container and chill. Keeps well in the fridge for up to 2 days.

2. **Make the Peanut Sauce**:  
   - Blend peanuts until finely chopped (not powdered). Set aside.  
   - Blitz onion, garlic, lemongrass, ginger, and sambal oelek to form a purée.  
   - Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Sauté the purée for 1 minute, then reduce to medium-low and cook for 25 minutes, stirring frequently.  
   - Add water and bring to a boil.  
   - Add chopped peanuts, simmer for 15 minutes.  
   - Add paprika, ground coriander, sugar, tamarind, and ½ tsp salt. Cook another 5 minutes.  
   - Remove from heat, cool slightly, and transfer to a bowl. Keeps in fridge for up to 5 days or freeze for longer.

3. **Make the Coconut Rice**:  
   - Place the rice, coconut milk, and lime leaves into a non-stick sauté pan.  
   - Add 700ml of water and 1¼ tsp of salt.  
   - Boil over high heat, then reduce to lowest setting, cover, and cook for 30 minutes.  
   - Increase heat to high and cook covered for another 15 minutes until a golden crust forms on the bottom. Remove from the heat.

Note: Serve everything together or as part of a set meal. Peanut sauce also pairs well with grilled chicken, tofu, or veg.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 pithon-paille ‘gnos’ anjou—wild honey, ginger, candle smoke. textural, strange, holds the heat. thirty-two quid. or a gewürztraminer.
or just grab a viognier.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Kernel Export India Porter—dark, bitter, bit tropical. rides nice with sambal.
Sheppy’s Vintage Cider—bold stuff. deep apple, little funk. won’t get lost in spice.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Tamarind Lime Cooler
Sharp tamarind, fresh lime, hint of maple, shaken hard over ice. Cuts the fat. Sparks the fire.

*🥥 Fluffy coconut rice with a crispy golden crust, rich peanut sauce that hugs everything it touches, and a zingy, crunchy cucumber relish to keep things fresh. It’s dinner in three acts: creamy, punchy, and cool as a cucumber.*
