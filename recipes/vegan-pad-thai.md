## Ingredients

8 oz rice noodles, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 cup firm tofu (cubed), 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1 cup bean sprouts, 1 red bell pepper (sliced), 2 green onions (chopped), 1/4 cup peanuts (crushed), 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons lime juice, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon sriracha (optional), fresh cilantro for garnish

## Method

In a bowl add the tamarind block with tepid water and mash with hand separating the pips and pushing it through a sieve.
Now whisk the sugar, salt, paprika, tamari and vinegar with the tamarind.

Blend Tamari Nori Seaweed and salt together to make 'fish sauce'.
In a mixing bowl break up the firm tofu with hands and crumble. Then add turmeric, salt and mix.
Soak the pad Thai noodles for 10-15 minutes in warm water.

In a hot wok add oil, shallots, garlic, 'Tofu Egg' and veggies. Cook for a few minutes then add noodles, Pad Thai sauce, fish sauce and stir fry for a few more minutes.

Finally, add in the beansprouts and chives for some extra crunch.
Serve on a plate and garnish with crushed peanuts, dry chilli flakes, coriander and a wedge of lime.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Alsace Riesling’s your friend here—clean strike of citrus, dances round the peanuts.
Or slide in a Tesco Gewürztraminer—lush, floral, slightly chaotic. Works.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** North Brewing Co. Lost Cosmonauts. Juicy IPA. Doesn’t judge your tofu.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Chili mango iced tea. Fragrant heat, soft sweetness.
Let it stain your lips.
