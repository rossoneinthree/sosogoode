### For the Thyme Oil
- 6 tbsp olive oil
- 2 green or red chillies, finely chopped

### To Serve

## Method

### Cook the Onions and Garlic
1. Get out your biggest pot and place it on a medium heat. Add a splash of olive or rapeseed oil and cook the 2 chopped onions, 8 cloves chopped garlic, thumb of chopped ginger and finely chopped chilli for 10 minutes, until soft and sweet.

### Add the Spices
2. Now add the 1 teaspoon of chilli powder, 2 teaspoons of smoked paprika, 1 tablespoon of cumin seeds and stir around in the pan for a minute or two.

### Add Everything Else
3. Then add the tablespoon of chipotle paste, 3 tins of chopped tomatoes, 2 drained tins of Puy lentils, 100g of bulgur wheat, 100g of quinoa, 1 can of black beans with their liquid and a tablespoon of cocoa. Add 1 litre of the stock to start with, and keep the rest on hand to add as needed if the chilli starts to look a bit dry.

### Simmer
4. Bring to a gentle boil, then turn the heat down to low and leave to simmer and blip away for 30-35 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and the chilli is deep and flavoursome. Add the remaining litre of stock as needed.

### Make the Thyme Oil
5. Make a thyme oil by mixing the 6 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 finely chopped chillies and the leaves from a small bunch of thyme with a sprinkling of salt and pepper.

### Finish the Chilli
6. Taste your chilli and add a little more salt and pepper if you like. Serve in bowls, topped with a little yoghurt, a drizzle of thyme oil and some warmed corn tortillas for scooping.
