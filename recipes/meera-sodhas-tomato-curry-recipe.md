### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** For Meera’s sun-bright tomato curry, Benji dreams of Grüner Veltliner or cheap, chilled viognier—late-summer fruit, affordable delight.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** A well-hopped IPA in your hand—its resinous cheer a shrug for the tomato’s tang—maybe a cloudy cider, scruffy and orchard-warm, or wheat beer rolling lazy citrus with every scoop of curry.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Tonic, bitter with lime, icy and clean; or a shrub of strawberry and mint, restraint and freshness, Noor’s choice for midday clarity.

*A vibrant, south Indian–inspired tomato curry starring ripe summer tomatoes, toasted spices, coconut milk, and curry leaves. Silky, aromatic, and perfect with rice or chapatis.*
