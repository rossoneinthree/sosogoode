type: main
protein: meat
effort: weeknight

## Ingredients

•	1.4 kg mussels (scrubbed and debearded) , 	•	250g chorizo (about 4 links, sliced ½ cm thick, then quartered) , 	•	120ml tomato confit (with oil, chopped) , 	•	2 tbsp shallot confit , 	•	6 cloves garlic confit, finely chopped , 	•	180ml dry white wine , 	•	180ml chicken stock , 	•	½ tsp crushed chilli flakes , 	•	A small bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped (roughly 20g)

## Method

Sauté the chorizo chunks in a large saucepan over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, or until it begins to brown and sizzle. Add the tomato confit, shallot confit, and garlic confit, stirring everything together. Let it cook for another 2–3 minutes until the chorizo has rendered most of its fat and things are smelling great.

Tip in the mussels and give them a good toss so they’re coated in the oil and chorizo. Gjelina recommends black mussels, but I used a different kind and it still turned out lovely. Pour in the wine and chicken stock, making sure to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. I like my mussels with extra broth, so I tend to be generous here.

Season with salt, black pepper, and the crushed chilli flakes. Cover loosely (you want a bit of steam to escape), and let it cook for about 5 minutes — until most of the mussels have opened up. Discard any that stay shut.

Stir in the chopped parsley, check the seasoning one last time, and serve immediately — ideally with some crusty bread to mop up that broth

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 la stoppa “trebbiolo rosso”—inky cherries, balsamic twang, sun-dried swagger. rustic and wild.
or a chilled lambrusco. fizzy, juicy, oddly perfect.
chorizo heat and tomato depth… calls for red with grip, but not weight. let it sing.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Alhambra Reserva 1925
Dunkertons Black Fox
smoky stew vibes, bit of fat in the broth. need a lager with muscle or a cider with funk.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Rebujito
Sherry and lemon soda. Bright, dry, unexpected. A Spanish nod—keeps the palate alive through all that richness.

*Adapted from the Gjelina cookbook, chunks of chorizo, tomato confit, garlic confit and shallot oil are then combined with wine and broth to create a luscious broth. A baguette is the perfect companion.*
