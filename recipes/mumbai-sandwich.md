### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 cos blanc from matassa—lime leaves, chalk dust, a whisper of wild herbs. thirty-two quid. alive and flickering. or just go with a grüner veltliner.
good torrontés from salta. jasmine, citrus, a tiny bit weird. seven quid. or just grab a sauvignon blanc.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Kingfisher Premium Lager
Sheppy’s Classic Draught Cider
Bit of crunch, bit of spice—lager keeps pace. Cider cools the heat. Both do the job.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Coriander-Lime Nojito
Crushed coriander, lime juice, sugar, and soda over ice. Bright, green, effervescent—echoes the chutney, lifts the spice
