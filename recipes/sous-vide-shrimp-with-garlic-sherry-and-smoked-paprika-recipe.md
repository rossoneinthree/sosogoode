### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 la cigarrera manzanilla—green olives, sea spray, almond skins. salty elegance. or just grab a dry sherry.
2019 albariño from zarate. lemon pulp, white flowers, sea breeze. twenty quid. would shimmer next to this. or a pinot grigio.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Estrella Galicia lager
Dunkertons Black Fox cider
clean, crisp, good with paprika heat. cider’s got enough backbone to play with the sherry.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Paprika & Orange Spritz (orange juice, smoked paprika syrup, soda water, dash of verjus)
Smoky, citrusy, bright—echoes the dish without competing. Serve cold in a stemmed glass.

*Cooking shrimp sous vide allows you to infuse them with flavor. In this recipe, we use the flavor profile of the Spanish tapas standby, gambas al ajillo.*
