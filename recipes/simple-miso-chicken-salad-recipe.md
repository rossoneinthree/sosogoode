### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 terlaner cuvée from alto adige. almond and mountain air. crisp and layered.
or just drink a chardonnay.
cool savoury miso, earthy soba, whisper of sesame—this one needs clarity and calm. alpine whites glide beside it like skaters on glass.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Hitachino Nest White Ale
Hogan’s Dry Cider
soft spice and citrus in the ale plays nice with miso. cider’s clean bite keeps things lifted. easy pairing. no fuss.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Yuzu & Cucumber Cooler
Bright yuzu, muddled cucumber, a touch of rice vinegar, shaken and poured long. Pure refreshment. Best served cold, in a tall glass with cracked ice.

*Miso chicken and soba noodles are the perfect salad combination.*
