## Ingredients

125g chopped dates , 3g bicarbonate of soda , 190ml boiling water , 55g unsalted butter , 65g light muscavado sugar , 65g dark muscavado sugar , 1 egg , 225g self-raising flour , 4g baking powder , a pinch of maldon sea salt , clotted cream, to serve , FOR THE TOFFEE SAUCE , 95g dark muscavado sugar , 30g light muscovado sugar , 125g unsalted butter , 125ml double cream , a pinch of maldon sea salt

## Method

Preheat your oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3.
Put the chopped dates, bicarbonate of soda and water into a saucepan and boil for 7-8 minutes, stirring frequently, until very dark. Take off the heat and set aside.
In a stand mixer fitter with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-help electric whisk, cream together the butter and both muscavado sugars.
Mix in the egg, followed by the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt.
Finally add the date mixture.
Throughly grease your pudding tins and pour the mix evenly into them. Cook in the oven for around 25 minutes, until risen and cooked through.
Remove from the oven and cool in the tins before turning out.
Meanwhile, make the toffee sauce. In a saucepan, gently heat together all the sauce ingredients. Once the butter and sugar have melted, turn up the heat and gently simmer for 5 minutes.
Turn off the heat, and leave to cool a little before serving.
Serve the puddings with the warm toffee sauce and a generous dollop of clotted cream.
