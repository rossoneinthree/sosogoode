## Ingredients

100g	pumpkin seeds , 100g	sunflower seeds , 75g	Sesame seeds , 75g	linseed , 200g	flour , 50 ml 	olive oiil , 50ml pumpkin seed oil (or olive) , 250 ml	boiling water

## Method

Flour (I use quite little, maybe about 50g)

Olive oil (or any other you fancy, my aunt uses pumpkin seed oil), I poured some in quite liberally*

About 1dl water just boiled 

Salt
 
Stir everything
 
Spread thinly onto baking tray (I line it with paper)
 
Preheat the oven to about 180
 
Bake for roughly 20-25 minutes (keep an eye on it from about 15 min)
 
Turn up the heat in the end if they need some extra browning – if you have too much heat in the beginning they burn while not being crisp throughout
 
*More oil means they get crispier quicker and brown better
