### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Etna Bianco. Grown on volcanic slopes—zesty, mineral, clean finish. Built for seafood with a bit of crunch. or, if you’re down Tesco way:
Picpoul de Pinet.

*Good prawns don’t need fuss—just garlic, chilli, wine, and a watchful eye. Cook quick, hot, fearless. Sicilian style means they’re bright, sharp, and not asking your opinion.

Don’t overcook. If you do, apologise to the prawns, not to me.*
