### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 domaine de la taille aux loups “remus” montlouis—honeycomb, baked apple, chalk. twenty-five quid. glowing heart of the loire. or a chenin blanc.
good white burgundy—ripe citrus, a whisper of oak, polished edges. or just have a chardonnay.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Harvey’s Sussex Best Bitter
Thatchers Gold
crispy skin, juicy bird—wants a malty ale an’ a clean cider. proper sunday vibe.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Lemon Highball
Lemon juice, smoked tea syrup, soda. Char and citrus echo the roast. Serve tall, ice cold, with a rosemary sprig.

*This beer can chicken recipe is a roast chicken recipe with a bit of a twist… Cooking the chicken like this steams it from the inside out, and makes the meat unbelievably juicy and flavoursome.*
