## Ingredients

1kg floury potatoes, eg Maris Piper or King Edwards , 50g butter , Splash of milk , 500ml fish stock , 100ml white wine , Small bunch of parsley, separated into leaves and stalks , 350g white fish fillets and / or salmon , 350g smoked white fish , 200g small peeled prawns , 50g butter , 50g butter , 200ml double cream , 2 anchovies, finely chopped , Handful of white breadcrumbs

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180C. Peel the potatoes and cut into evenly sized chunks. Put in a large pan, cover with cold water, add a generous pinch of salt, and bring to the boil. Simmer for about 20 minutes, until tender. Drain, and allow to sit in the colander for a few minutes, then mash until smooth, and beat in the butter and a splash of milk. Season well and set aside.

2. Put the fish stock, wine and parsley stalks into a large pan, and bring to a simmer. Add the fish, and simmer for five of minutes, then lift out with a slotted spoon, remove the skins if any, and cut into large chunks. Discard the parsley stalks.

3. Melt the butter in a medium pan over a lowish heat, and then stir in the flour. Cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, being careful not to let it brown. Gradually stir in the stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer for about 20 minutes.

4. Take the sauce off the heat, stir in the double cream, parsley leaves and anchovies and season. Add the fish and prawns and toss to coat.

5. Put the seafood and sauce into a baking dish and top with the mashed potato. Bake for 20 minutes, then sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and bake for a further 15, until the top is golden.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Premier Cru Chablis brings the sea and the stone—doesn’t miss.
But Muscadet from Waitrose will glide through this like a hot knife. £7, no trouble.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St Austell Tribute. Bit creamy, bit floral. Bit like the pie.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Salted cucumber tonic. A sip like low tide and linen.
Chill until fogged.

*Creamy, comforting, and deeply satisfying, this fish pie layers buttery mash over a luxurious mix of white fish, smoked fish, prawns and a herby, anchovy-spiked sauce. Finished with golden breadcrumbs for a touch of crunch, it’s the kind of dinner that makes everything feel alright again. ( all British main pescatarian )*
