## Ingredients

- 6 shallots
- 8 garlic cloves
- 1 stalk lemongrass
- 1 (2-inch) piece ginger
- 5 dried red chiles
- 2 Thai red chiles, for extra spice (optional)
- 5 tbsp oil
- 5 tbsp Malaysian curry powder (usually labelled "meat curry powder"), I use Baba's or Alagappa's
- ½ tsp chile powder, plus more to taste
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 star anise
- 10-15 curry leaves
- 2½ lb bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks
- 4 cups water, or enough to cover chicken
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 1½ cups coconut milk

## Method

1. In a food processor, blend the shallots, garlic, lemongrass, ginger, and both chiles until they form a smooth paste. (Alternatively, pound with a mortar and pestle until smooth.)

2. Heat up the oil in a deep pot or wok set over medium heat. Add the blended paste and stir-fry until it turns fragrant and intensifies in colour. This should take 6-8 minutes.

3. Add the curry powder, chile powder, and salt, frying for another 3-5 minutes, or until the spice paste starts to glisten and split and you can see an oily film separate from the paste itself. This is the "pecah minyak" stage. (If your paste is cooking too quickly and starts to burn, add a teaspoon or two of water.)

4. When the spice paste has reached the "pecah minyak" stage, add the cinnamon stick, star anise, curry leaves, and chicken. Mix and continue frying for 3-5 minutes, until the chicken is evenly coated in the curry paste.

5. Pour water into the pot until the pieces of chicken are just covered. Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer for 10 minutes.

6. Add the potatoes, and simmer for another 25-30 minutes, until both the chicken and potatoes are cooked through.

7. Pour in the coconut milk. Give it a quick stir, and let the curry simmer for another 2-3 minutes. Taste the curry, adding more salt if necessary.
