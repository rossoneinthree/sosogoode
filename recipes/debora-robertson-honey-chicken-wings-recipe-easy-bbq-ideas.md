## Ingredients

8–10 (about 1kg) chicken wings
150ml runny honey
100ml dark soy sauce
4 cloves of garlic, halved, green germ removed, and very finely chopped
1 tbsp Tabasco sauce
1 tbsp concentrated tomato purée
1 tbsp ground ginger
200ml sour cream
80ml mayonnaise
2 cloves of lic, halved, green germ removed, and very finely chopped
3 tbsp chopped fresh chives
3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves
2 tbsp chopped fresh dill
½ tsp  English mustard powder
salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

<p>In a large bowl, whisk together everything for the marinade and add the chicken wings. Turn them over and make sure they are very well coated, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. Take them out of the fridge about an hour before you want to cook them.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Line a large baking tray with foil and arrange the wings on it, leaving space between them. Pour over any extra marinade and roast for 40–45 minutes, turning once or twice.</p>
<p>In a bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the dip and serve it alongside the wings, with lots of paper napkins.</p>
<p>Tip: You can also cook these on the barbecue if you want. Place them on a medium-hot part of the barbecue and cook for about 20–25 minutes, turning periodically and brushing with the marinade a couple of times – you should let them cook for at least 10 minutes after the final brush of marinade.</p>
