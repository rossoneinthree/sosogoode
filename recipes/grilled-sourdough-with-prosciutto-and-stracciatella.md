### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Franciacorta if you’re feeling fizzy—classier than Champagne, just as bold.
Or a Lambrusco Secco—lightly sparkling, savoury red, around £8 if you know the shop.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St Austell Tribute. Bit creamy, bit floral. Bit like the pie.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** White peach and bay leaf cordial. Lush, savoury, impossible to rush.
Best poured slowly

*cheese and ham on toast but luxe (all snack italian meat)*
