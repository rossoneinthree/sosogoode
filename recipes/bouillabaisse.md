### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 château simian châteauneuf-du-pape blanc. white peach, anise, warm stone. thirty quid. textured enough to stand up, graceful enough to dance. or just get a picpoul de pinet.
2018 la bastide blanche bandol blanc—fennel, sea air, a quiet power. twenty-four quid. swims right in. or just have a dry white from the Rhône.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Duvel – Belgian golden strong ale, dry and punchy, bright enough for the broth
Thatchers Gold – apple sharpness cuts the oil, keeps it lively

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Saffron & Citrus Collins
Lemon juice, saffron syrup, soda. Floral, sharp, golden—draws out the stew’s complexity without competing. Serve tall, twist of orange.

*A flexible and rewarding French seafood stew, classically served with rouille and crisped bread, based on a rich fish or lobster stock.*
