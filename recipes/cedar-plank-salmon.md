### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 marsannay blanc from sylvain pataille—smoky citrus, struck match, golden hush. thirty-two quid. woodsmoke loves this. or a chardonnay.
2022 château de la grave côtes de bourg rosé—raspberries, rosehip, whisper of earth. eleven quid. or just grab a rosé from the supermarket.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Vedett Extra White
Dunkertons Organic Dry Cider
Bit of smoke, bit of fat—this calls for crisp stuff. The cider’s bone dry, cuts through lovely. Beer’s got spice and snap.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Rosemary Paloma (zero-proof)
Grapefruit and lime with a smoked rosemary sprig. Bright against the salmon, haunting with the cedar. Serve chilled, tall, over ice.

*Where this recipe calls for lemon zest and rosemary, the native Coast Salish Indians on Vancouver Island would use grand-fir needles. Either way, the salmon takes on a light, smoky woodiness from grilling on a cedar plank, for a lovely pairing of earth and ocean.*
