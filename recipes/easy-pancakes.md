### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Benji thinks a flute of Crémant or a splashy Moscato d’Asti, darling, elevates morning pancakes—or grab a bottle of Yellow Tail Bubbles for less.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Nothing like a bready wheat beer, says Rugsby, maybe a Belgian wit or even apple cider for that brunch fizz. Crack a Hoegaarden, let it fizz, or tip a dry Aspall into a glass as syrup drips down your chin—now that’s pancake living.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Classic Noor: Serve with a tall, cold glass of orange juice topped with sparkling water and a sprig of mint.
