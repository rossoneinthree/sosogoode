### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 greco di tufo from terre d’ulivi—bitter almond, citrus pith, golden light. seventeen quid. so clean it hums. or just have a verdicchio.
peppery greens, roasted squash, little pools of oil—it’s a late-summer whisper. salty and bright with a bitter kiss.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Saison Dupont
Thatchers Katy Cider
peppery saison’s got lift for the greens, cider’s crisp enough for the roast bits. keeps things lively.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery Tonic with White Grape & Lemon
Mineral, tart, and lightly vegetal. Matches arugula’s edge, tempers the sweetness of squash. Serve chilled, with a celery ribbon.
