## Ingredients

### For the fish

- 2 thick sea bass fillets, skin on
- Fine salt
- Neutral oil
- Knob of butter

### For the admiral sauce

- 50g butter
- 4 anchovy fillets, roughly chopped
- 1 tbsp capers, plus a splash of brine
- 1 garlic clove, microplaned or finely grated
- Small handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- Zest of ½ lemon
- Juice of ½ lemon
- 1 tsp cherry vinegar (or red wine vinegar or good balsamic)

## Method

### Prepare the fish

1. Pat the fish skin completely dry with a clean cloth or kitchen paper. For extra crispy skin, leave uncovered in the fridge for an hour or more.

2. Season the flesh side only with salt (not the skin).

### Make a non-stick surface (optional)

3. If your pan tends to stick, heat a tablespoon of fine salt in a dry cast iron pan until it starts to caramelise. Discard the salt and wipe clean — you now have a non-stick surface.

### Cook the fish

4. Heat your pan until very hot. Add a good glug of oil and lay the fish skin-side down, away from you.

5. Apply gentle pressure with a spatula for about 10 seconds until you feel the fish relax — this is the membrane breaking down.

6. Reduce the heat to medium. After a minute, gently rotate the fish 90° to ensure even contact and no pale patches.

7. Add a knob of butter and baste the flesh gently as it cooks. The fish is ready when about 85% cooked through (you'll see the white creeping up the sides, with a thin translucent line remaining in the centre).

8. Remove from the pan and rest briefly while you make the sauce.

### Make the admiral sauce

9. In the same pan, add the butter and let it foam and turn nut brown — just past golden, but not burnt.

10. Take off the heat. Add the anchovies, capers and a splash of their brine (this cools the butter before adding garlic).

11. Stir in the garlic, lemon juice, cherry vinegar and parsley.

12. Drizzle the warm sauce over the fish, being careful not to drench the crispy skin.

*The salt-in-pan trick turns any pan into a non-stick surface. Perfectly cooked fish should be translucent and moist — never stringy, tough or dry.*
