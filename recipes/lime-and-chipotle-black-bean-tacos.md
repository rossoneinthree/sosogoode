## Ingredients

2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely chopped , olive oil , 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon , 1 teaspoon ground cumin , 1 teaspoon chipotle paste or 1 red chilli, finely chopped , 2 × 400g tins of black beans , sea salt and freshly ground black pepper , For the salsa , 20 cherry tomatoes , 1⁄2 a red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped , a few sprigs of fresh coriander, leaves picked , juice of 1⁄2 a lime extra virgin olive oil , For the guacamole , 1 avocado , juice of 1⁄2 a lime , For the crunch salad , 1 small apple , juice of 1⁄2 a lime , a few leaves of white cabbage or a little gem lettuce , 4 radishes, sliced , a few sprigs of fresh coriander

## Method

Heat a frying pan on a medium heat, then add the garlic and a splash of olive oil and cook for a minute or so, until the edges of the garlic begin to just brown. Add the cinnamon, cumin and chipotle paste or chilli and stir for another minute to gently toast the spices. Add the beans and their liquid, bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down and cook for 10–15 minutes, until the liquid has thickened but the beans are still holding their shape. If you need to, add a little hot water to loosen. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm.

While the beans are cooking you can get on with the other jobs. To make your salsa, chop the tomatoes roughly on a big board. Pile the chilli and coriander on top, season with salt and pepper and chop all this together. Scrape into a bowl, add the lime juice and a splash of olive oil and mix well. Set to one side.

To make the guacamole, peel the avocado, remove the stone, and mash in a bowl with a little salt and pepper and the lime juice. You can use a potato masher if you like.

Now for the salad. Chop the apple into little shards and put them into a bowl. Squeeze over the lime juice, add the shredded cabbage or lettuce, radishes and coriander, season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little oil.

Once everything is ready, heat your tortillas. I do this by holding them with tongs over the flame of my gas hob – it’s super-quick and gives a delicious charred taste – but the oven will do just fine. Put the beans, salad, guacamole and salsa in separate bowls on the table, along with the tortillas and grated cheese, and let everyone make their own. Don’t forget the chilli sauce, and sometimes a little yoghurt works well too.
