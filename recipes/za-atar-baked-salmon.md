## Ingredients

600 g salmon filet 
salt
2 Tbsp za'atar
1 Tbsp sumac
1 Tbsp olive oil 
Lemon zest
Lemon juice
Garlic grated
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp black pepper 

## Method

Pre-heat the oven to 140 °C, fan.

Oil or place a baking paper in an oven dish that fits the salmon snugly.

Salt the salmon (keeping in mind there is a salt in the za'atar topping too) and place on the oven dish, skin side down.

Mix all the ingredients for the za'atar topping. Spread it gently on top of the salmon fillets.

Bake in the middle of the oven until the salmon is as you like it, 10-15 minutes. How long the salmon needs depends on how well-cooked you like your salmon as well as the effectiveness of your oven. The salmon pictured is 300 grams and I roasted it for 13 minutes. Serve immediately with your preferred sides.
