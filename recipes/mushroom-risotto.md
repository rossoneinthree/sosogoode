### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Benji recommends a brisk Pinot Grigio for crisp elegance or reach for a thrifty Soave—either way, your risotto dreams will be dreamy.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Ah, nothing says comfort like a sturdy pint of brown ale, mushrooms clinging to malty arms; or perhaps a lightly funky cider, with its orchard hum blending with earthy depths—lay back, let Rugsby pour.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Chilled cucumber-mint fizz, delicately aromatic, is Noor’s quiet evening recommendation.
