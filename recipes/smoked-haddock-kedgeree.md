### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 pepière muscadet—lemon, seashells, lightning. bright and proper. or just have a sauvignon blanc.
smoke and spice, wrapped in warm rice. salt needs light. this sings with white stones and citrus air.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Adnams Southwold Bitter
Sheppy’s Vintage Reserve Cider
gotta cut the smoke but not lose the soul. this’ll do it. beer’s nutty. cider’s bold but crisp. tidy.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber & dill tonic
cool, vegetal, and clean. cucumber soothes the smoke, dill teases out the fish. serve with cracked ice.

*This warm and comforting smoked haddock kedgeree can be enjoyed for brunch, lunch or supper. It’s a classic dish combining spiced rice with fish and boiled eggs.*
