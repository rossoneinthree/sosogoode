### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 grüner veltliner from nigl—white pepper, lime peel, clean minerality. twenty-two quid. dances bright against the funk. or just grab a dry riesling.
sharp and savoury needs bright and nervy. the kimchi crackle, the umami swell—let the wine slice clean.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Beavertown Neck Oil
Kentish Pip High Diver
kimchi kicks—so keep it crisp. neck oil’s got the zip, high diver’s got the twang. both’ll ride the heat easy.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Yuzu & Ginger Highball
Fragrant, fiery, and direct. Yuzu’s citrus spark meets ginger’s heat—served tall over ice, topped with soda. Keeps pace with the funk.

*Broccoli florets get lots of love, but this flavorful, sizzling dish is all about those stalks and leaves (also: kimchi).*
