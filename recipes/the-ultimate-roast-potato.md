## Ingredients

Potatoes (low starch) , Neutral oil , Garlic , Rosemary , Thyme

## Method

1. Prep the Potatoes (Night Before)
	•	Peel & soak potatoes in cold water overnight to remove excess starch.
	•	Use low-starch potatoes like Agrea for the best texture.

2. Boil the Potatoes
	•	Bring heavily salted water (like seawater) to a boil.
	•	Simmer for 35 minutes, stirring gently every 5 minutes to start roughing up the edges.

3. Drain & Steam
	•	Drain and let steam dry for 5-6 minutes.
	•	Lightly fluff the potatoes by shaking them in the pot to create rough edges.
	•	Season with fine salt to draw out moisture.

4. Heat the Fat
	•	Preheat oven to 180°C (356°F).
	•	Heat duck or goose fat (or cooking oil) in a deep roasting tray until almost smoking.
	•	Carefully pour hot oil over the potatoes to start the crisping process.

5. First Roast
	•	Roast at 180°C (356°F) for 40 minutes without moving them.
	•	Let the hot oil ‘set’ the crisp around the potatoes.

6. Second Roast & Finishing Touches
	•	Add fresh thyme and garlic (don’t add earlier or they’ll burn).
	•	Roast for another 10 minutes until golden and extra crispy.

7. Serve
	•	Transfer to a tray with paper towels to drain excess oil.
	•	Season with fine salt, ensuring it gets into all the crispy cracks.
	•	Serve piping hot, with ultra-crispy edges and a fluffy center.

Enjoy the best roast potatoes of your life! 🥔🔥

*This recipe delivers the crispiest, most indulgent roast potatoes. The key is low-starch potatoes, a pre-boil for ultra-fluffy edges, and a deep roast in hot duck/goose fat for maximum crunch. A final toss with garlic and fresh herbs elevates the flavor without burning. (all british side)*
