## Ingredients

2 tablespoons olive oil , 1 medium onion, diced , 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced , 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped , 2 tsp paprika , 1 tsp cumin , 0.25 tsp chili powder , 1 400g can whole peeled tomatoes , 6 large eggs , salt and pepper, to taste , 1 small bunch fresh coriander, chopped , 1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped

## Method

Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.

Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.
Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer.

Use your large spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack the eggs into each well. Cook the eggs for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the eggs are done to your liking. You can also cover the pan with a lid to expedite the eggs cooking.

Garnish with chopped cilantro and parsley before serving.
Lisa’s Tips

If you’re not dairy-free, crumbled feta or goat cheese on top is delicious addition. Traditionally it’s also served with pita, but I love to serve it with slices of avocado.
