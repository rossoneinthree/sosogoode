### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 terlaner cuvée from alto adige. almond and mountain air. crisp and layered.
or just drink a chardonnay.
salty-sweet glaze calls for structure and shine. this one’s clean like a white shirt drying in alpine sun.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Asahi Super Dry
Thatchers Gold
sauce’s got sweetness, needs bite. beer’s sharp. cider’s fresh. clean finish on both.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Shiso & Lime Highball
Crisp, green, electric. Shiso’s herbaceous edge flatters the glaze. Serve tall, with ice that sings.

*This Teriyaki Chicken recipe with a delicious sticky sauce makes a brilliant, quick, healthy, midweek meal. Just stir fry and serve.*
