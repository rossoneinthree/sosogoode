*is there any culinary pleasure like a creamy, carby dish of dauphinoise potatoes? Well, perhaps a mound of buttery mash, a fluffy jacket potato with melted cheese or a big pile of chips with rich, yellow mayonnaise – consider this the fancy French dinner party version of all of the above. That said, you don’t need to use guests as an excuse; I’d eat it straight from the dish in my pyjamas.*
