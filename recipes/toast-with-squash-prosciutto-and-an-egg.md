## Method

Heat your oven to 450F. Mince together the thyme and the garlic clove. Rub the cut sides of the squash with olive oil, the garlic and thyme, oregano, chile flakes, and several pinches of salt.

Put the squash halves in a baking dish cut sides up and cover tightly with foil. Roast in the oven until the squash is tender enough to be easily pierced by a knife in the thickest part. Flip the cut sides down, remove the foil, and roast about 10 more minutes until the cut sides are
caramelized. Remove from the oven and allow to cool enough to handle.
(3)
Heat a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the prosciutto slices just long enough to warm and slightly brown them, then transfer them to a plate. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, swirl to coat then crack in the eggs and sprinkle them with salt.

Cook the eggs to your liking - I do over-easy. To assemble the toasts smash a big scoop of squash on each piece of toast then top with a slice of prosciutto and a fried egg.
Serve immediately.
