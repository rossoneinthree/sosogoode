### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 grüner veltliner from malat—white pepper, lime zest, snap of fresh greens. twenty quid. would dance with the chilli. or just drink a sauvignon blanc.
2019 albariño from rías baixas—zippy, clean, tastes like green apple washed in sea salt. or just grab a pinot grigio.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Beavertown Neck Oil
Sheppy’s 200 Vintage
lime cuts, chilli kicks, beer keeps it light. cider’s bright and sharp—like biting into cold autumn.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber & Jalapeño Cooler
Fresh lime, muddled cucumber, a whisper of jalapeño, topped with soda. Clean heat, cool finish.

*Try our quick chicken sandwich for one. Coat a chicken breast in a chilli-lime marinade, cook in a griddle pan and pop in a bun with Greek yogurt guacamole, lettuce and tomato*
