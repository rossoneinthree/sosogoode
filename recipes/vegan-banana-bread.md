### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** benji hums: try a 2018 domaine de la taille aux loups montlouis-sur-loire (fragrant, £19); or joyously affordable tesco finest sauvignon blanc (£6).

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** rugsby grins: a bottle of hoegaarden for the mellow wheat notes, or a chilled kopparberg pear cider if you want a little sweet lift. let the crumbs linger, let the sips linger too.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Noor recommends a cardamom iced chai with almond milk—smooth, spiced, and entirely refreshing.

*Use up your ripe bananas to make easy vegan banana bread – the perfect breakfast treat to enjoy with your morning cuppa. We love it toasted with peanut butter.*
