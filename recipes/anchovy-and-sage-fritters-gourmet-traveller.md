### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 fiano from pietracupa—lemon oil, wild herbs, a lick of salt. twenty-two quid. sharp but generous. or just grab a vermentino.
green and briny, crisp and hot—these want a wine that hums like sea air on stone.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Braybrooke Keller Lager
Pilton Cider
lager’s clean snap plays nice with the salt + sage. and that pilton—proper funky cider, cuts the oil right down.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery & Sage Gimlet (Zero Proof)
Seedlip Garden, lime cordial, celery bitters, fresh sage. Herbal, savoury, whisper-bright. Keeps up with the fritter’s swagger.

*Anchovy and sage fritters are crispy bites packed with bold flavors. These golden fritters are perfect as appetizers or snacks for gatherings.*
