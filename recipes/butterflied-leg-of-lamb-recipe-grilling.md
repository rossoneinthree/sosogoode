### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** benji sighs: ‘pop open 2018 domaine tempier bandol (around $70) if you can, or a juicy 2021 borsao garnacha for twelve bucks – both dance with grilled lamb, rich and easy.’

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** rugsby nods, thumb hooked in belt: ‘pull a chimay red for the lamb, dark fruit and foam splitting the earth with each bite. then cider — aspall, sharp as a spring orchard — for the lemon and mint, hands sticky, sun low.’

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Noor: A sparkling mint lemonade with a whisper of tahini syrup; bright, refined, and quietly lavish.

*A perfectly grilled butterflied leg of lamb marinated with tahini, lemon, mint, and spices, served with grilled lemon and fresh mint. A showstopping centerpiece for any cookout.*
