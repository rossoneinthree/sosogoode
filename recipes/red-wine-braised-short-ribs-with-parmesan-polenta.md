## Ingredients

### Short Ribs
- 3 bottles dry red wine
- 2-4 tbsp neutral oil (canola, sunflower, or vegetable)
- 10-12 bone-in beef short ribs, excess fat trimmed
- Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
- 2-3 tbsp all-purpose flour, for light dredging
- 8 large shallots, finely chopped
- 3 carrots, thinly sliced
- 3 celery ribs, thinly sliced
- 2 leeks (white and light green parts only), thinly sliced and well washed
- 10 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- 3 tbsp tomato paste
- 3 bay leaves
- 3 thyme sprigs
- Small handful fresh parsley stems
- About 3 cups good-quality beef broth

### Parmesan Polenta
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups water
- 1½ cups polenta or coarse-ground cornmeal
- 1½ tsp salt, plus more to taste
- ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¾ cup heavy cream

## Method

### Short Ribs

1. Pour the wine into a large saucepan and bring to a strong simmer. Let it cook down until deeply reduced and aromatic, with the harsh alcohol smell cooked off. Set aside.

2. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Season short ribs generously with salt and pepper and lightly dust with flour. Heat oil in a large, heavy oven-safe pot and sear ribs in batches until deeply browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate.

3. Lower heat to medium. Add shallots, carrots, celery, leeks, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and parsley stems. Cook until vegetables soften and take on light color (about 10-15 minutes), stirring occasionally. Stir in tomato paste and cook until slightly caramelized.

4. Return ribs to the pot. Pour in the reduced wine and enough beef broth so the ribs are mostly submerged. Bring to a gentle boil, cover tightly, and transfer to the oven.

5. Braise for about 2½ to 3 hours, until the meat is very tender. **Cook's Note:** Short ribs can feel tight and dry before they're actually done. Don't panic! They need time for the connective tissue to fully break down. If you pull them too early, they'll seem dry — but given more time, they relax and become meltingly tender.

6. **Rest (optional but recommended):** Let the ribs cool in the braising liquid. For the cleanest sauce, refrigerate overnight and remove the solidified fat from the surface the next day.

7. Gently rewarm the ribs and transfer them to a plate. Strain the braising liquid, pressing on the solids, and return the liquid to the pot. Simmer until the sauce is glossy, rich, and slightly thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning. Return ribs to the sauce to warm through.

### Parmesan Polenta

1. In a medium bowl, combine the 1½ cups of polenta with 2 cups of cold water. Stir until the grits are well mixed with the water and there are no lumps. This step helps prevent clumping when you add them to the hot liquid.

2. In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of chicken broth to a boil over medium-high heat along with 1½ teaspoons of salt.

3. Slowly whisk the cold polenta mixture into the boiling liquid and stir continuously for 5 minutes.

4. Reduce the heat to low so the mixture is just simmering. Cover the saucepan for 15-20 minutes. The polenta should be creamy and tender. If it's too thick, you can add a little more broth or water.

5. Once the polenta is cooked to your desired consistency, remove from heat. Stir in the 3 tablespoons of butter until it's completely melted, then gradually add the cup of Parmesan cheese, stirring until well incorporated. Add the heavy cream and stir in until completely combined.

6. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt or pepper if necessary.

7. Serve the polenta hot in a bowl, top with short ribs, ladle red wine beef reduction on top and enjoy this luxurious meal!
