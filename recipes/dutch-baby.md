*I’ve only ever eaten Dutch babies in the States, where they are brought out to you at the table with great pomp: great pancakes puffed up and golden, still in the cast-iron skillets they were cooked in. Obviously, I had to make my own at home. Not being a restaurant, I don’t want to be juggling with heavy pans, giving each person their own, so I’ve made mine a giant one for sharing; this ain’t no baby, that’s for sure. The “Dutch” of the title doesn’t in fact refer to Holland, or anything to do with that country, but rather owes its name to the fact that this particular pancake comes from the German-American community known as the Pennsylvania Dutch and would originally have been served with melted butter, sugar and lemon, and indeed they often still are. While you can, of course, serve this mega-pancake just sprinkled with granulated sugar and lemon juice or, for a more diner taste, with a side order of bacon and maple syrup, I like it tumbled with berries and dusted with icing sugar with a bowl of creme fraiche within arm’s reach. I confess, I also add an ooze of maple syrup as I eat.*
