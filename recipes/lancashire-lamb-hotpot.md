## Ingredients

### For the Lamb
- 2-3 lamb shanks (about 1.2-1.5 kg total)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (e.g. rapeseed or vegetable oil)
- 2 onions, quartered (leave the root end on)
- 2 carrots, roughly chopped
- 1 celery stick, roughly chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- ¼ bottle red wine (about 175ml)
- 400ml beef stock (plus a little chicken stock if needed)
- 2 thyme sprigs
- 1 bay leaf

### For the Sauce
- 30g butter
- 1 tbsp flour (for thickening)
- 1 tbsp buerre manié (equal parts soft butter and flour mixed together, optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 small clove garlic, crushed
- 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves

### For the Potato Topping
- 4-5 Charlotte potatoes (or another waxy potato like Jersey Royal or Anya), thinly sliced
- 25g melted butter
- 2-3 tbsp reserved stock (from braise)
- Clarified butter for brushing

## Method

### Sear the Lamb Shanks
1. Heat oil in a large heavy pan. Season lamb shanks generously and sear until browned all over. Remove and set aside.

### Build the Base
2. In the same pan, add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook until lightly golden and aromatic, scraping up the fond. Deglaze with red wine and reduce by half.

### Braise the Lamb
3. Add beef stock (and a touch of chicken stock if needed) to just cover the meat. Add thyme and bay leaf. Return lamb to the pot, cover with a lid, and braise at 160°C (320°F) for about 3½ hours until tender but still holding together.

### Cool and Prepare the Meat
4. Remove lamb and bones. Pull meat into large chunks (keep the bones for presentation if desired). Strain and reserve the braising liquid.

### Make the Filling Sauce
5. In a clean pan, melt the butter and gently cook diced onion, carrot, celery, and garlic until soft but not browned. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually add the strained stock until thick and glossy. Add thyme leaves, salt, and pepper to taste. Fold in the lamb chunks carefully until just coated.

### Prepare the Potatoes
6. Thinly slice the Charlotte potatoes (ideally 2-3mm thick). Toss in a bowl with melted butter, a little stock, salt, and pepper. This ensures even seasoning and prevents dry layers.

### Assemble the Hotpot
7. Spoon the lamb mixture into an ovenproof dish or copper pot. **Optional:** Stand the reserved lamb bones upright in the center for presentation. Layer the potato slices on top, overlapping neatly for the final layer. Brush with clarified butter for shine.

### Bake
8. Bake uncovered at 160°C (320°F) for about 35-40 minutes, until the potatoes are golden, crisp at the edges, and tender through.

### Finish and Serve
9. Brush with a little hot stock to glaze before serving. Serve directly from the pan with seasonal greens or pickled red cabbage.

### Chef's Notes

- **Texture balance:** The sauce should be thick enough to suspend the meat — too thin and it'll bubble through the potatoes.
- **Rest before serving:** Let the hotpot sit for 10-15 minutes out of the oven for the flavors to settle.
- **Presentation tip:** Keep the upright bones from the lamb shanks — they act as visual anchors and elevate the rustic presentation into something showstopping.
