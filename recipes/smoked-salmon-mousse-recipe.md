### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 loire chenin blanc—orchard fruit and beeswax. fourteen quid. full of soul. or just grab a riesling.
smoke and cream ask for a wine with quiet power. chenin listens—sweet-natured, a little waxy, full of light. riesling cuts sharper, but still loves a little fish.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Augustiner Helles
Henny’s Vintage Dry Cider
soft mousse needs crisp backup. helles is mellow gold. henny’s got bite but stays polite. both do the job, no drama.

*Galton Blackiston serves up a stunning smoked salmon mousse recipe, which is incredibly simple to make in a Vitamix.*
