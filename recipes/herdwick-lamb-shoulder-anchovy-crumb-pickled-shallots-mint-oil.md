### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2016 brunello di montalcino from il poggione. dark cherry, sage, old wood. forty-two quid. serious and soaring. or just have a chianti.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Harvey’s Sussex Best Bitter
Pilton Somerset Keeved Cider
That bitter’s got backbone and malt warmth. Pilton’s keeved drop is orchard-sweet and softly wild—perfect for that anchovy pop.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery & Mint Collins
Celery cordial, fresh lime, mint oil, soda. Clean, green, and bracing. Cuts the fat, lifts the herb. Serve long and cold.

*With most meats I enjoy the cheaper cuts which can be cooked slowly with bags of flavour. We get our Herdwick lamb from a wonderful collective of farmers based in the Lakedistrict who truly care for their animals. The Herdwick lamb is a breed native to the Lakes and can be replaced with any of your choosing. Generally speaking, the longer you allow the meat to cook, the better the end result will be, It should be tender enough to eat with a spoon once you're done.*
