### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 domaine du closel “la jolla” savennières—ginger, quince, rain-slick slate. twenty-six quid. sings with crunch and spice. or a dry riesling.
good dry riesling from alsace. lime, petrol, green herbs. or just grab a vinho verde.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Thornbridge Lukas Helles Lager
Hogan’s Dry Cider
snappy, fresh, bit gingery this one. lager keeps it clean. cider’s got that crisp snap to match the apples.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** White Tea & Ginger Fizz
Soft white tea, muddled apple, ginger syrup, splash of soda. A bright, lifted pour with quiet heat. Best served cold, no garnish needed.

*Accented with Asian seasonings, this coleslaw is a lovely, refreshing side. Red cabbage makes it particularly beautifully hued, but other cabbages work well too. This goes well with anything from grilled halloumi or tofu to salmon and pulled pork.*
