### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2010 ghemme from cantina del signore. faded roses, iron, crushed cherries. thirty-two quid. slow and deep, like a cello in a cold room. or a montepulciano.
2019 montepulciano d’abruzzo—warm plum, soft tobacco, no fuss. nine quid. proper with braise and bone.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Rochefort 8
Sheppy’s Vintage Reserve Cider
Big stew needs big drink. Rochefort’s deep n’ boozy. Cider’s rich, a bit woody—spot on for the marrow moments.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Zero-Proof Negroni
Bittersweet depth to hold its own—equal parts Lyre’s Italian Orange, Aecorn Aromatic, and Everleaf Forest. Stirred cold, twist of orange. Velvet with veal.

*Felicity Cloake: Have you tracked down English rose veal shin, where do you stand on the great tomato debate and is risotto alla milanese the best accompaniment?*
