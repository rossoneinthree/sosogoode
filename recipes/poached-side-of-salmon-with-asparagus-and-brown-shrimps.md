## Ingredients

butter, for greasing , side of salmon fillet, skin on , small bunch of dill , 50 ml white wine , juice of 1 lemon , salt and freshly ground black pepper , For the dressing: , 1/2 banana shallot, finely diced , 2 tsp Dijon mustard , 3 tbsp white wine vinegar , 150ml light olive oil , 1 tsp caster sugar , 1 bunch of dill, chopped , To garnish: , 20 asparagus tips, cut in half , 100 peeled cooked brown shrimps, patted dry , pink radishes, sliced, or pink micro herbs

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/Gas 4. Lightly butter a large sheet of foil big enough to wrap the salmon, and place over a large roasting tin (see tip).

2. Place the dill in the centre of the foil. Season the buttered foil with salt and pepper and place the salmon on top, skin side up. Pour over the white wine and lemon juice. Bring the two long edges of the foil together and fold the edges together, scrunching them up to make a parcel and sealing the edges at the side like a Cornish pasty (see tip).

3. Place in the oven to poach for about 25 minutes until the salmon is just cooked, the flesh pale pink and opaque. Leave to rest for 10 minutes. Then carefully remove the skin, pulling off in one piece if possible (see tip). Use a palette knife to scrape off any grey fat.

4. Blanch the asparagus tips in a saucepan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh under cold water. Mix all of the dressing ingredients together in a jug, and season with salt and pepper.

5. Using two fish slices, carefully transfer the salmon to a serving platter. Arrange the asparagus along the length of the fish, scatter the shrimps over the top and spoon over some of the dressing. Garnish with slices of radish or micro herbs and serve at room temperature with the remaining dressing in a jug.

Cook time: 25-30 minutes plus resting.

Prepare Ahead:
Assemble the dish up to 3 hours ahead. The salmon can be poached up to 8 hours ahead and the dressing made up to a week in advance.

Mary’s Classic Tips:
* If you don’t have a roasting tin large enough for the length of the piece of salmon, the grill pan makes a good alternative.
* Make sure you have a good seal around the edges of the foil parcel before baking it. This will ensure no steam escapes out of the sides, and the fish will cook beautifully inside.
* It is so much easier to remove the skin from the salmon while it is still warm; if the salmon cools down too much, the skin will stick firmly to the flesh and be tricky to remove.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 grosset polish hill riesling—lime, wet slate, thrilling tension. thirty quid. would cut through the butter like a whisper. or just grab a picpoul de pinet.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Weird Walk Keller Lager – soft fizz, hay and herbs. Proper lunch beer.
Sheppy’s Vintage Cider – ripe apple, bit of funk, holds its own. Good with cold fish.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber Elderflower Collins
Delicate and long. Crisp cucumber and elderflower lilt mirror the green and the sea. Serve tall, cold, with a cucumber ribbon.

*This is a great dish – so quick and simple to prepare, with great results. If you have a good fishmonger, who will prepare the salmon well, nicely trimmed and pin-boned, there is very little to do, except serving it up and impressing your guests.*
