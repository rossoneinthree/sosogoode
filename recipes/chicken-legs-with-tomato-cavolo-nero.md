### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Start with a Barolo—dark cherry, forest floor, bit of swagger.
Or you could go for a juicy Nero d’Avola from Sicily—£8 and built for this sort of night.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Five Points Best. East London pint for a low-key roast.
Drink with: one foot on the radiator.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Sour cherry and rosemary soda. Red, herbal, brooding.
Serve with a long look.
