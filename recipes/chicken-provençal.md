### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 château de pibonnet côtes de provence rosé—rose petal, thyme, sun-faded peach. soft and dry, like a Provençal sigh. eighteen quid. or just get a grenache rosé.
2022 la vieille ferme rosé—light strawberries, herbs, heat-haze. six quid. does the job, no drama.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Petrus Saison—peppery, dry, summery but got backbone.
Dunkertons Organic Black Fox Cider—crisp, floral, with a herby edge that nods to the dish.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Herb & Citrus Cooler
Lemon juice, rosemary syrup, green tea, dash of olive brine. Shaken and poured tall over ice. Lush, herbal, and sunlit—like sipping under cypress trees.

*Cater for a crowd with this easy, hearty chicken casserole that evokes summer in Provence using a fragrant selection of herbs, tomatoes, olives and artichokes.*
