## Ingredients

4 eggs , 180g milk , 90g plain flour , 1/4 tsp salt , 80g butter , 20g parmesan , 15g fresh parsley, dill & tarragon , To serve , 200g smoked salmon , 50g creme fraiche , 2tsp fresh dill , 1 tbsp lemon juice , 1 tsp lemon zest , 1/4 tsp salt

## Method

- Preheat your oven to 230°C (445°F) and place your cast iron pan on the middle shelf. Make sure there's enough space above it for your Dutch Baby to expand.

- In a stick blender jug add the eggs, flour, milk & salt. Blend until smooth and aerated. This can also be done in a stand up blender.

- Leave the mixture to stand whilst the oven comes up to temperature. The closer the mix is to room temp, the better rise you'll get in the finished product.

- Grate the parmesan, chop the herbs fine and mince the garlic.
Transfer to a bowl. I like to add a pinch of salt to this mixture also.
- When you're ready to go, remove the pan from the oven and add the butter. Let it bubble and melt down completely. Then pour your batter mix into the pan.

- Scatter the cheese and herb mix over the top and return to the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not open the oven during this time.

*This is your Christmas morning one pan breakfast: the Smoked Salmon Savoury Dutch Baby.

If you've never heard of a Dutch Baby before, it's like a cross between a pancake and a Yorkshire pudding. They're more eggy than a Yorkshire and are originally made to be sweet, filled with fruit, cream or whatever you want.

But they're also not Dutch! They are based on the crepe-like German pancake called pfannkuchen. Named by a mispronunciation of "Deutsch" (meaning German) as "Dutch".

1/4 of this recipe was perfect for breakfast/brunch for me. It's actually quite light and will leave room for Christmas Day chocolates and dinner later on. (all nordic breakfast)*
