### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 sylvain pataille marsannay rosé. salty strawberries, white pepper, surprisingly serious.
or just go with a rosé from the supermarket.
char meets silk. the smoke and heat love a cool berry whisper. pepper and crunch in slow conversation.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Põhjala Kosmos
Hogan’s Killer Sharp
nutty fire, roasted edges—need hops and acid. pale ale lifts it, sharp cider cuts it.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Lemonade Collins
Charred lemon syrup, soda, rosemary, and a hint of chilli tincture. Bright against the butter.

*Fire up the barbecue (or use the oven) and get into the latest food trend, charred veg. This charred hispi cabbage with hazelnut chilli butter is a great side dish*
