## Ingredients

Canned chickpeas , cannellini beans , Red onion , Bell peppers , Cucumber , Kalamata olives , vegan feta , Fresh parsley , salt , olive oil , lemon juice , oregano , dijon mustard , grated garlic , maple syrup

## Method

1. Prepare the veggies. Chop the red onion, bell peppers and cucumber into bite-sized pieces. I use this vegetable chopper to ensure that everything is evenly sized. It saves loads of time too! Slice the pitted Kalamata olives.

2. Rinse the beans. Drain, rinse and dry the chickpeas and navy beans.

3. Add all salad ingredients to a large mixing bowl.

4. Add the salad dressing. Whisk or shake the dressing ingredients together and pour overtop the salad. Toss well to combine.
