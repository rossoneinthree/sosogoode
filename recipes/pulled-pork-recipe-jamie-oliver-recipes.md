### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** a glass of 2017 ridge vineyards zinfandel (california, £45) or a plucky la vieille ferme rouge (£7), both breathing smoky tales beside your pork.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** go for a sierra nevada pale ale, foamy and bitter-citrus, or a frosty aspall's suffolk cider if you're feeling orchardy; both are honest company for pork done low and slow; you'll want another plate and another round.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** noor recommends a chilled virgin apple julep, pressed apple juice muddled with fresh mint and a twist of lime, served on ice.

*A smoky American classic, this Southern-style pulled pork is slow-cooked for melting tenderness and dressed with mint and chilli. Paired with a crunchy, fresh apple and collard greens slaw, it’s perfect with crackling and a cold beer.*
