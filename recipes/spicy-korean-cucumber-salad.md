### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Benji’s pick: A crisp Korean baekseju for a splurge, or a lively, chillable Vinho Verde rings the bells with cucumber’s cool fire.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Rugsby rasps: Sip a downy wheat beer like Weihenstephaner for the mellow spice, or crack a chilly, dry apple cider—cloudy, tart, and summery. If you can score a light Korean lager paired with backyard heat, you’re golden.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Noor notes: Serve with a chilled yuzu sparkling spritz, over ice with a slice of cucumber—simple, elegant, bright.

*Smashed cucumbers are coated in an incredibly delicious sweet-salty-spicy-tangy sauce in this Spicy Korean Cucumber Salad. Refreshing, beyond flavorful, and an impressive yet easy side dish or appetizer for the summer.*
