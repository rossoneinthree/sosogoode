## Ingredients

- 1–2 cloves garlic, grated , - 1 tin cannellini beans , - a small knob of butter , - a few sprigs of rosemary, leaves finely sliced , - good extra virgin olive oil , - salt

## Method

method
heat a generous splash of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. add the grated garlic and let it sizzle gently—don’t let it colour. once fragrant, stir in the rosemary and let it infuse the oil for a minute.

add a small knob of butter and a splash of the liquid from the bean tin to deglaze the pan. rinse the rest of the beans and tip them in. stir and let them cook in the garlicky, buttery oil.

mash some of the beans with a spatula to make things creamy, but leave a few whole for texture. season to taste. eat warm.

notes
so so good with lemon zest or a pinch of chilli flakes on top. also excellent with a fried egg or tucked under roast veg.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** A cold Albariño – zesty, citrusy, with just enough weight to handle the beans and spice, or a young Garnacha (served slightly chilled) – bright red fruit, soft tannins, and nothing too serious.

Corner shop option:

“That Torres Viña Sol in the fridge door? That’s your mate. £7 and it gets it.”

*a silky, savoury bean situation. halfway between a mash and a stew, with bits of whole bean clinging to the rosemary oil. a great alt for potato when you want more protein less carb.*
