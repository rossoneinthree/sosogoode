### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 domaine gauby “les calcinaires”—smoke, sandalwood, simmered plum. southern soul with polish. thirty quid. would glide with the spice. or a shiraz.
2019 clos du tue-boeuf vin rouge. cranberries, cracked pepper, low-key charm. sixteen quid. or just grab a rioja.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Madri Excepcional
Thatchers Gold
creamy spice and roasted chicken? soft lager, cold cider. let the sauce lead, you follow.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Tamarind & lime no-jito
Tamarind’s tang and lime’s cut echo the curry’s warmth. muddle fresh mint, top with soda. sharpen with a chili salt rim.

*Bonus: It’s ready in 30 minutes.*
