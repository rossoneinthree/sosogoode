### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2022 château d’esclans “rock angel” rosé—minerals, white peach, summer’s breath. twenty-eight quid. would glide alongside this like a breeze. or just have a pinot grigio.
2021 sylvain pataille marsannay rosé. salty strawberries, white pepper, surprisingly serious. or just go with a rosé from the supermarket.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Kona Big Wave Golden Ale
Thatchers Haze
Bit of sun in a bowl. These’ll keep it light, sweet, juicy. Haze gives peach-on-peach. Lovely.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Verjus Spritz
Bright, tart verjus with tonic and a twist of orange. Echoes peach without shadowing it. Serve very cold.

*Perhaps due to Italy’s hot summers, Italian cuisine, especially southern Italian cuisine, offers a dazzling variety of frozen desserts. Gelato is probably*
