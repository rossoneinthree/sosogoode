## Ingredients

800g/1lb 12oz beef bavette, cut into 4 steaks , 100ml/3½fl oz extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for cooking , garlic , parsley , oregano , red wine vinegar , fresh chili , salt , pepper , olive oil

## Method

Fire up the BBQ and get the coals as hot as possible. Lightly coat the whole onglet steak in oil, then season generously with salt and black pepper about 5 minutes before cooking. Once the grill is scorching, place the steak over the hottest part. Move it around and flip as needed to develop a rich, caramelised crust. Cook for about 6–8 minutes total for medium-rare, but use a Thermapen or meat thermometer to check—it should read 52–54°C before resting.

Rest the steak for 10 minutes, then slice against the grain to maximise tenderness. Serve with a punchy chimichurri, made with parsley, oregano, garlic, red chilli, red wine vinegar and olive oil. Fresh, sharp, and perfect with smoky beef.

Bittersweet, rich, and brooding—just like that steak. Stirred down, orange twist. Let it linger.

*This dish showcases a bold, flavour-packed steak cut, either onglet or bavette, both known for their rich, beefy depth and loose-grained texture. Grilled quickly over intense heat to develop a smoky crust while staying tender inside, the meat is then sliced against the grain for maximum tenderness.*
