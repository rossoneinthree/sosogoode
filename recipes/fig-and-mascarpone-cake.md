## Ingredients

250g mascarpone , 180g caster sugar , 3 large eggs , 250g self-raising flour , 1 teaspoon baking powder , a pinch of salt , 8 fresh figs, stems removed, quartered , 1 tablespoon icing sugar

## Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C / Gas Mark 4. Grease a 23cm springform cake tin with butter and line the base and sides with baking parchment.
Beat the mascarpone, sugar and eggs together until you have a smooth cream. Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt and stir until well combined. Gently stir in the quartered figs, then spoon the batter into the prepared cake tin.
Bake for 40–45 minutes, until the cake is lightly golden and a knife or skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. If you press the top of the cake with your finger, it should spring back nicely. Cool the cake in the tin for 10–15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust lightly with the icing sugar.
