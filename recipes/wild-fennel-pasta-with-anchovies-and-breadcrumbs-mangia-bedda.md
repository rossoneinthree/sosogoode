### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 pepière muscadet—lemon, seashells, lightning. bright and proper. or just have a sauvignon blanc.
that fennel, those anchovies—briny and wild. needs a white with cut and clarity. let it echo the sea.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Augustiner Helles
Dunkertons Black Fox Cider
fennel’s a funny one—herbal and sharp. this lager’s clean enough to carry it. cider’s got grip and bite.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Celery Tonic Spritz
Celery juice, tonic water, lemon oil. Herbal, bitter, sparkling. Mirrors the fennel, lifts the anchovy. Serve cold, tall, with a rosemary twig.
