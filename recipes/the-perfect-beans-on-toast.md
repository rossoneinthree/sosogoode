### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** benji murmurs: with 2021 domaine leflaive bourgogne blanc (£38), or a humble co-op sauvignon blanc at £6, savor candlelight or daytime cheer.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** rugsby says: call a mate and crack an abbot ale, let the baked beans bring their twang, and after the cheddar melts, tip a westons vintage cider, golden and tart, for that proper pub finish.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Noor recommends a cold cucumber mint lemonade, elegantly poured over ice with a twist of lemon zest.

*A quick, easy, and delicious British classic—beans on toast—ready in minutes and upgraded with gooey mature cheddar for ultimate comfort.*
