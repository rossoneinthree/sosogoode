### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Verdicchio’s got that lemon peel and herbal lean—it’s like the dish made a twin.
But there’s a Soave in Lidl that’s £5 and sharper than your ex. Try that.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Vedett Extra White. Clean and citrusy. Like showering mid-summer.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber kefir. Bright, slightly unruly.
A drink with spring in its step.
