### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 assyrtiko from santorini—sea breeze, crushed shells, lightning in a bottle. thirty quid. born for lemon and herbs. or just go for a sauvignon blanc.
2019 gaia ‘thalassitis’ assyrtiko. bracing and mineral, like sunlight on stone. or a sauvignon blanc.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Mythos lager
Sheppy’s low alcohol classic cider
Bit of Greek lager never hurts. Sheppy’s got the crisp to match lemony chicken—zings right in.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cucumber–lemon fizz
Bright, herbal, cooling. Cucumber juice, lemon, dash of agave, topped with soda. Mint garnish. Feels like a breeze on the Aegean.

*Jamie’s Lemon-tzatziki chicken dish from 5 Ingredients Mediterranean is a flavour-packed one-pan dish, inspired by his travels to Greece. A family favourite!*
