### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2019 frappato from occhipinti. cherry skins, roses, a bit of wildness. twenty-six quid. gentle and bright, like red silk in the wind. or a chilled lambrusco.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Menabrea Bionda lager
Dunkertons Organic Craft Cider
Clean bite of the lager cuts the fried bit. Cider’s got that ripe-tangy thing. Both’ll sort you out.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Crodino spritz (Crodino, soda, orange slice)
The crisp bitter-orange edge plays against the richness. Serve cold, plenty of ice, just enough bubble.

*This year we may be missing out on Sicilian street food, but there’s always Alba Allota’s recipe for making these delectable, deep-fried rice balls at home*
