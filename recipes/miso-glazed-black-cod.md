🍷 **Wine:** 2021 domaine testut chablis 1er cru—wet stone, lemon rind, cold silk. thirty-two quid. bright enough to meet the miso, soft enough to let it shine. or just have a chilled picpoul.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Asahi Super Dry
Pulpt Level—crisp Somerset cider, not too sweet
Clean, sharp combo—lets the cod talk. Dry stuff wins here.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Yuzu & White Tea Spritz
