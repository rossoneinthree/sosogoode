### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 loire chenin blanc—orchard fruit and beeswax. fourteen quid. full of soul. or just grab a riesling.
lively, earthy, quietly rich—this wants a wine that hums not shouts. the chenin melts into goat’s cheese and finds friendship in roast grapes.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St. Bernardus Wit
Perry’s Somerset Dabinett Cider
yeasty wit’s got enough citrus lift for the lentils. dabinett’s mellow tannins sit real nice with cheese and sweet grape skins. quiet banger of a pairing.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Verjus & Thyme Spritz
gentle acidity from verjus mirrors the grapes. thyme syrup, soda, a twist of lemon. bright, herbal, impeccably dressed.

*An ancient recipe for a sprightly side dish or salad with an eccentric ingredient combination that surprisingly works a treat*
