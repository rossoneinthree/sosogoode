## Ingredients

8 medium floury potatoes, such as maris pipers or king edwards (about 800g-1kg) , 6 garlic cloves, peeled , 3 bay leaves (optional) , 50g butter , 2 tbsp dry breadcrumbs, tossed with a little olive oil (optional)

## Method

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Find an ovenproof frying pan or a heavy, hob-safe baking tin that’s just large enough to hold the potatoes in a single layer.

Put each potato in the bowl of a wooden spoon and, at roughly 2mm intervals, cut carefully down, but not quite through, the potato, maintaining a slight angle towards the centre of the potato.

Slice the garlic, and stuff several pieces into each potato, making sure you push them well down so they don’t burn. Tear the bay leaves, if using, into several pieces and do the same.

Fill the slices with garlic or bay for flavour.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in the pan or tin over a medium heat until sizzling. Put in the potatoes one by one, and carefully turn them in the butter to coat, then pour in enough cold water to come halfway up the sides of the potatoes.

Coat the potatoes with butter, add some water and bring to a boil on the hob.

Bring to a boil, then roast for an hour and 30 minutes, basting every 15 minutes. Scatterwith the breadcrumbs, if using, for the final 15 minutes of cooking, at which point you can add any remaining garlic to the pan as well. Serve hot from the oven.
