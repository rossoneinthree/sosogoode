## Ingredients

400g cream cheese , 50g goats curd , 140 g caster sugar , 1/4 orange zest , 2 whole eggs plus 1 yolk , 180ml double cream , 20g plain flour , roasted fruit creme fraiche to serve

## Method

Heat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Whisk the cream cheese, goat’s curd, sugar and orange zest until it is light and glossy. Whisk in the eggs and the yolk one at a time. Gently whisk in the cream, slowly sift in the flour and mix thoroughly.

Line a cast-iron frying pan (about 25cm wide) with baking paper. Pour in the mixture and bake for 30 minutes, then rotate and cook for a further 15 minutes. The aim is for the cheesecake to rise like a soufflé and caramelise, almost burning, on top.

Remove the cheesecake from the oven and cool for an hour – it will sink slightly. Slice and serve it with roasted fruit, such as rhubarb or peaches, and some creme fraiche.

*The recipe itself is fairly simple, but the secret to its success is the outer crust, which is cooked on a higher heat until heavily toasted, almost burnt looking, while the inside stays soft and creamy.*
