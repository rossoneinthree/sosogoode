### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2019 xinomavro from thymiopoulos—wild herbs, cherry skins, tannins like sunbaked stone. twenty-six quid. earthy and radiant. or a syrah.
soft lamb and soft light—needs a red with grip, with shadow. xinomavro whispers and holds on. syrah will do the job too.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Fix Hellas lager
Dunkertons Black Fox cider
bit of greek lager for the sun-on-white-stone feeling. or that black fox—dry, fruity, bites back just enough.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Lemon & Olive Brine Spritz
Smoky lapsang syrup, lemon juice, olive brine, soda. Complex, bracing, Mediterranean. Serve with a rosemary sprig.

*Rich, soft and full-of-flavour lamb with classic Greek flavours and a gentle chilli heat.*
