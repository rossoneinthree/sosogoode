### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 terlaner cuvée from alto adige. almond and mountain air. crisp and layered.
or just drink a chardonnay.
smoky onions, tart sumac, wild herbs—this calls for clarity. alpine whites cut through the haze, whisper coolness over embers.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Pilsner Urquell
Sheppy’s 200
lightly charred onion wants a clean crunch or soft fizz—this does both. sumac gets along lovely with that cider’s tang.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Sumac Spritz
Sumac syrup, grapefruit juice, soda water. Bracing. Floral. Pour over rocks, garnish with a sprig of mint. Cuts smoke with a shimmer.

*Pomegranate molasses is the secret weapon in this sweet-and-sour flame-kissed onion salad, a traditional side dish at Turkish grill houses.*
