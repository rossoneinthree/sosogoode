### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2017 bual madeira from d’oliveiras—burnt sugar, walnuts, old wood smoke. fifty quid. rich and endless. or just have a ruby port.
sticky toffee asks for something slow, deep, and echoing. this one hums like dusk in madeira.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout
Westons Vintage Cider
deep roasty beast or bold old apple—either’ll hold their ground. pudding won’t scare ’em.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Vanilla Cold Brew Old Fashioned
Coffee, date syrup, a drop of orange blossom, smoked salt. Over ice. Rich enough to chase the pudding, sharp enough to cut it.
