### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 pouilly-fumé from didier dagueneau—smoke, flint, citrus oil. forty-five quid. built for fire and crunch. or a sauvignon blanc.
2022 picpoul de pinet—lime, sea breeze, white snap. eleven quid. clean and snappy. or just go with a dry white.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Lost and Grounded Keller Pils
Crafty Apple by Sheppy’s
Szechuan’s got zip. This lager’s cold and noble. Cider’s mellow sharp helps cool the sparks.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Ginger Yuzu Spritz
Zesty, spiced, and bright. Yuzu cuts through the fry; ginger teases the tongue. Serve in a chilled coupe with a twist.
