## Ingredients

halloumi , chili oil , honey , flatbread , tzatziki , pomegranate , coriander

## Method

Slice the halloumi into 3cm thick strips.

Place all remaining ingredients, excluding the olive oil, into a bowl and mix well until you have a runny consistency. If your marinade needs to thicken up add a little more honey or if it’s too runny add a little extra lemon juice.

Place the halloumi into a small baking tray or deep dish pan and spoon the marinade all over. Cover and leave to marinate for a minimum of two hours or ideally overnight.

In a fry pan on a medium heat, bring your olive oil to heat. Add several pieces of the halloumi to the pan and fry for 2 - 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Make sure you don’t overcrowd the pan and work in batches. Repeat this step until you have cooked all of the halloumi.

Drizzle the cooked halloumi with the remaining marinade and enjoy in salads or on sourdough.

*There is something truly addictive about pan fried halloumi that has been doused in a sweet marinade and is then cooked to golden, caramelised and sticky perfection. This is one moreish way to eat cheese but it has to be one of my favourite ways. (fusion snack all)*
