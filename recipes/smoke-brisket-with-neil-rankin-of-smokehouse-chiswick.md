### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 laurent combier crozes-hermitage—violets, smoked meat, silky black plum. thirty quid. deep and brooding. or a syrah.
2019 domaine dupeuble beaujolais. juicy red berries, soft spice, light touch of earth. eleven quid. or just go with a pinot noir.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** St. Bernardus Abt 12
Hogan’s French Revelation
sticky ribs of a beer. dark, strong, a bit biblical. cider’s sharp, bright—cleans up nice after the smoke.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Tea Old Fashioned (zero-proof)
Lapsang souchong, orange bitters, maple, dash of saline. Bold, dusky, perfect beside brisket’s depth. Serve over one large rock.
