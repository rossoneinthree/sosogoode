### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 cos frappato—wild strawberry, dried herbs, crushed rock. twenty-six quid. sinewy and light but full of heat. or a nero d’avola.
2019 cota 45 ube miraflores palomino—salt, fennel, lemon peel. twenty quid. unexpected and perfect. or just get a chilled vermentino.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Sierra Nevada Pale Ale
Crafty Nectar No. 8 Cider
spicy pasta wants grip. pale ale’s got that citrus punch. cider’s clean and sharp—cuts the oil, sings with the fish.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Smoked Tomato & Basil Shrub Spritz
Tomato sweetness, basil perfume, and a wisp of smoke mirror the dish. Topped with soda, served cold in a coupe.
