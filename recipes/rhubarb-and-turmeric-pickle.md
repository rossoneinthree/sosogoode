*I love the typically Indian oily pickles eaten with curries, but they are also great with cold meats, cheese and in a sandwich – or they can brighten a simple dal. This recipe was given to me by a dear food ritual friend, Martin, who loves a good curry. He adapted it from a recipe by New Zealand food writer Digby Law.*
