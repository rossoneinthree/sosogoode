## Ingredients

50g butter softened , 1 vanilla pod split open and seeds scraped out , ½ tsp pink peppercorns , ½ tsp black peppercorns crushed in a mortar, , 100g caster sugar , 6 large ripe bananas peeled , 320g ready-rolled sheet of all-butter puff pastry

## Method

Preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6.
❷ Spread the butter evenly across the base of a 20cm (8in) ovenproof frying pan. Add both the vanilla pod and seeds. Top with a third of the crushed peppercorns, then sprinkle over the sugar.

❸ Peel the bananas and cut into pieces 3cm–4cm (11⁄4 in -11⁄2 in) thick. Arrange them cut side down in concentric circles in the pan so that they are the same height as the rim. Sprinkle over another third of the crushed peppercorns.

❹ Unroll the pastry sheet and, using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle. Drape the pastry over the bananas and tuck the edges down the sides of the pan with the back of a spoon. Pierce the pastry a few times with the tip of a sharp knife.

❺ Place the pan over a medium-high heat for 3–4 minutes, until the sugar dissolves, then shake gently as it caramelises to a toffee colour and starts to bubble up the sides. Transfer to the oven and bake for 30–35 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Leave the tarte to stand for 10 minutes, then invert it carefully on to a serving dish.

Before turning out the tarte, give it a quick blast of heat on the hob, shaking the pan slightly to help to release the fruit cleanly from the caramel.

❻ Remove the vanilla pod, sprinkle the tarte with the remaining crushed peppercorns, then cut into wedges and serve.
