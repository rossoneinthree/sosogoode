### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Pigato from Liguria if you can find it—herbal, breezy, alpine-summer vibe.
Or just get the Pecorino from M&S—it’s green, it’s lean, it gets it.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Peroni Red. Not the normal one—the red label job. Better pesto energy.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Basil seed lemonade. Cloudy, green, gently strange.
Stir until it shimmers.

*don’t trust the jar. it’s not pesto, it’s shampoo. Fresh pesto is not a luxury it’s just fresh basil, oil, and sense. No need for ceremony. No need for pine nuts either. Almonds will do. Walnuts too, if you rinse the bitterness out. even breadcrumbs work if it's good enough for Massimo Bottura... 

Go easy on the garlic. Start with half a clove. Taste. Adjust. Again. And again. It’s not maths, it’s listening.*
