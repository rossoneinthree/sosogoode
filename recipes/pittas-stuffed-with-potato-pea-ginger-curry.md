### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2018 loire chenin blanc—orchard fruit and beeswax. fourteen quid. full of soul. or just grab a riesling.
spice wants sweetness, and this chenin hums just right. warm fruit, mellow texture. sunset-in-the-kitchen vibes.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Einstök Icelandic Toasted Porter
Dunkertons Black Fox
curry wants roast or fizz. this porter’s dark and smooth like river rock. cider’s sharp enough to dance through heat.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Tamarind & Ginger Highball
Tamarind syrup, fresh lime, a whisper of ginger shrub, topped with soda. Complex, tart, and perfectly in rhythm with the curry’s warmth.

*Ingredients Feeds 6 For the curry 800g floury potatoes, peeled and cut into rough 2cm chunks 2 tsp fenugreek sees 2 tsp coriander 3 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp nigella seeds 1 Chile de árbol or 1 tsp dried chilli flakes 1 large knob of ginger, peeled and cut into chunks 4 tbsp vegetable oil*
