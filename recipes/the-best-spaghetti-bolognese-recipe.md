### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Benji recommends a velvet Chianti for splurge, or the heartily affordable Montepulciano d’Abruzzo for weekday bliss.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Rugsby'd reach for a bottle of robust English brown ale, its toasted malt rubbing shoulders with the meaty sauce—maybe even a cold session lager or dry apple cider for a breezy midday bolognese by the window.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Noor suggests a basil & citrus spritz: tonic, fresh basil, twist of orange and lemon.
