### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 terlaner cuvée from alto adige. almond and mountain air. crisp and layered.
or just drink a chardonnay.
soft light meets soft spice. this one lifts the lentils, wraps them in alpine breeze. quiet magic.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Timothy Taylor’s Landlord
Henny’s Dry Cider
smooth and honest. bitter edge on the beer cuts the ghee, cider’s sharp with the lentils. no fuss.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Cumin Lime Spritz
Cumin simple syrup, lime juice, soda water. Serve tall over ice with a coriander leaf.
Earthy, bright, and quietly electric. Mirrors the dal’s warmth, lifts the finish.
