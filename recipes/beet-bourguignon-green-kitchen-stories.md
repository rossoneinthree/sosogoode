### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 refosco dal peduncolo rosso—plum skin, forest floor, a hum of herbs. twenty-three quid. earthy but fresh. or a grenache.
good zweigelt from austria. cranberry, beet, and black pepper. eleven quid. soft and vibrant. or just have a pinot noir.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** BrewDog Planet Pale – citrusy bite, bit green, goes with roots
Dunkertons Organic Black Fox Cider – mellow tang, proper orchard stuff

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Ruby Root Fizz
Beet shrub, ginger syrup, soda. A sparkle of vinegar, a kiss of spice. Bright, modern, alive. Serve in a coupe.
