### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2020 château musar jeune rouge—spiced plum, earth, something ancient in the bones. fifteen quid. warm and generous. or just grab a syrah.
2019 domaine gramenon “la sagemathie.” pepper, crushed berries, incense smoke. thirty-two quid. would hold the lamb like a secret.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** BrewDog Jet Black Heart – stout with a bit of chocolate and roast, smooth enough to ride the spice
Dunkertons Organic Dry Cider – proper structure, cuts the richness sharp and clean

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Sumac Tomato Cooler – tomato juice, lemon, sumac syrup, celery bitters, topped with soda
Earthy, bright, lightly spiced—mirrors the dish, sharpens the edge. Serve with a basil leaf.

*If you love shakshuka, then give these special eggs from Baghdad a try: eggs fried in a spiced cumin and coriander butter, with finely diced celery and onion, served with crispy pitta chips and a herby labneh dip.*
