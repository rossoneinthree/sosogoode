### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2016 meursault from jobard—melted butter, hazelnut, candle wax. sixty-five quid. like drinking slow gold. or just grab a chilled chardonnay.
good white burgundy sings here. lemon and roast skin want something creamy, grounded, a bit plush.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Fuller’s London Pride
Ashton Press Cider
Rich roast and lemony lift? Pride holds up. Ashton’s got the bite. Classic job.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Lemon Thyme Spritz (thyme syrup, fresh lemon juice, soda water, dash of apple cider vinegar)
Bright citrus with a herbal sigh. Elevates the bird, sharpens the mood. Serve cold, in a tall glass.

*The Nosey Chef has written about some pretty ancient food milestones, but I think we might be breaking a record with the domestication of chickens. Wild chickens still exist. These are the Gallus…*
