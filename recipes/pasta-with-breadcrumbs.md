## Ingredients

•	extra virgin olive oil for cooking , 	•	40g fine dried breadcrumbs , 	•	50g unsalted butter , 	•	1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped , 	•	1 garlic clove, finely sliced , 	•	1 salted anchovy, chopped , 	•	zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon , 	•	120g Parmesan cheese, grated , 	•	a handful of sage leaves , 	•	400g dried spaghetti, linguine or bucatini , 	•	sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

Heat a little oil in a small sauté pan and gently fry the breadcrumbs until they start to turn
light golden brown. Drain and reserve.

Add a slug of olive oil to a medium sauté pan over a medium heat, then add the butter.
When the butter starts to bubble gently and foam (not brown), stir in the chilli, garlic and
anchovy. Cook for 30 seconds, then add the lemon zest and juice. Remove from the heat. Add the
Parmesan and stir and stir. Keep warm.

Cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions. Drain, reserving
some of the pasta cooking water.

Transfer the pasta to the buttery lemon sauce along with a lug of pasta water. Return to the
heat and stir well to coat the sauce, using a spoon or tongs, ensuring that all the pasta is
shiny and emulsified. Serve piled into bowls with a little more salt and black pepper,
then serve immediately sprinkled with the breadcrumbs.

*I love this pasta recipe. It’s a Sicilian classic, little known outside of the island. Lemon is the star of the show and everything else the talented supporting cast.
The addition of butter isn’t the traditional Sicilian way and by including it I am risking life and limb.
The Sicilians would use lots of olive oil, but I think the addition of butter gives the sauce a lovely
velvety texture and gently tempers the mouth-puckering acidity of the citrus. Use the very best
fruits available to you, unwaxed and full of lemony character. (all main italian vegetarian)*
