### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** 2021 pepière muscadet—lemon, seashells, lightning. bright and proper.
or just have a sauvignon blanc.
delicate fish, a whisper of ginger, greens on the side—this needs clarity. light and mineral, like a tide washing in.

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Augustiner Helles
Aspall Premier Cru Cider
clean, crisp job. fish and ginger play nice with somethin’ fresh and snappy. banger of a dinner.

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Ginger & Yuzu Highball
sharp yuzu, fresh ginger syrup, soda. bright, linear, and perfectly tuned to the fish. serve tall with a twist of lime.

*An aromatic, low fat dish that is high in Omega 3 and ready in just 30 minutes.*
