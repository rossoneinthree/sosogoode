## Ingredients

- 4 tbsp gochujang paste
- 2 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 3 tbsp rice wine
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp caster sugar
- 4-5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
- 1kg skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
- 250ml hot chicken stock
- 2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped
- 8 garlic cloves, peeled
- 650g baby potatoes, halved (larger ones cut into thirds)
- 4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced
- 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Whisk the gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, sugar and ginger in a jug.

2. Put the chicken in a large bowl, spoon over three tablespoons of the gochujang sauce and toss to coat. Pour the stock into the jug with the remaining sauce and whisk.

3. Put the onions, garlic, potatoes and chicken in a 30cm x 40cm roasting tin, then pour over the sauce/stock mix.

4. Cover the tin with foil, then roast for 30 minutes.

5. Remove the foil, turn down the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then return the tin to the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the chicken is lovely and crisp and the tops of the potatoes are golden.

6. Scatter on the spring onions and sesame seeds, and serve at once.

### Drink Pairings

🍷 **Wine:** Off-dry Riesling or Gewürztraminer to balance the gochujang heat

🍺 **Beer/Cider:** Korean lager (Hite, Cass) or a crisp pilsner

🥤 **Soft Drink:** Barley tea or sparkling water with lime

*A take on dakdori tang (Korean chicken and potato stew), reimagined as a quick traybake. The potatoes soak up every drop of that rich, deeply savoury gochujang sauce.*
