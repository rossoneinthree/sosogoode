## Ingredients

ingredients:   • 6 slices Jamaican bun (or ~250g), thick-cut   • 2 hot cross buns, torn into chunks   • butter, softened (enough for spreading)   • zest of 1 orange   • 3 eggs   • 350ml whole milk   • 150ml double cream   • 50g light brown sugar   • 1 tsp vanilla extract   • optional: splash of dark rum   • 8–10 mini chocolate eggs, halved   • extra: apricot jam, for glazing

## Method

method:  
1. preheat oven to 170°C (fan). butter a medium-sized baking dish.  
2. butter the Jamaican bun slices generously. layer them in the dish with torn hot cross bun chunks.  
3. tuck halved mini chocolate eggs in between slices — like buried treasure.  
4. whisk eggs, milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, orange zest (and rum, if using).  
5. pour custard evenly over the bun slices. press gently to help soak.  
6. let it sit for 15–20 minutes. pre-bake nap for maximum flavour.  
7. bake 30–40 mins until golden, puffed, and just set.  
8. optional: warm a spoon of apricot jam, brush over top for gloss.  

serve warm. best with cream, custard, or a splash of condensed milk.
